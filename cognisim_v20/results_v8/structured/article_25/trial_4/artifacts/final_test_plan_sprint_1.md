# Final Test Plan - Sprint 1

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** Utilize Qualys or Rapid7 for automated scanning and manual checks.
- **Open Source Analyses:** Implement Black Duck or WhiteSource for automated license compliance and security vulnerability detection.
- **Network Security Assessments:** Deploy Cisco Stealthwatch for traffic analysis and anomaly detection.
- **Gap Analyses:** Use NIST Cybersecurity Framework as a baseline for identifying gaps.
- **Physical Security Reviews:** Engage third-party security consultants for on-site inspections.
- **Questionnaires:** Develop custom questionnaires based on FFIEC IT Examination Handbook.
- **Scanning Software Solutions:** Integrate Nessus for comprehensive vulnerability scanning.
- **Source Code Reviews:** Apply Veracode or Checkmarx for static application security testing (SAST).
- **Scenario-Based Tests:** Design scenarios in line with ENISA guidelines for operational resilience.
- **Compatibility Testing:** Use automated testing tools like Selenium for software compatibility checks.
- **Performance Testing:** Implement Apache JMeter for stress and load testing.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Coordinate with QA teams to use HP ALM for test management.
- **Penetration Testing:** Contract certified ethical hackers for structured attack simulations.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** Quarterly
- **Open Source Analyses:** Bi-annually
- **Network Security Assessments:** Semi-annually
- **Gap Analyses:** Annually
- **Physical Security Reviews:** Annually
- **Questionnaires:** Bi-annually
- **Scanning Software Solutions:** Quarterly
- **Source Code Reviews:** With each major release
- **Scenario-Based Tests:** Annually
- **Compatibility Testing:** With each major release
- **Performance Testing:** Semi-annually
- **End-to-End Testing:** With each major release
- **Penetration Testing:** Annually

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):** Oversight of the entire programme.
- **IT Security Managers:** Coordinate specific testing activities.
- **Security Analysts:** Execute tests and analyze results.
- **Compliance Officers:** Ensure tests meet regulatory standards.
- **Internal Auditors:** Validate the integrity of the testing process.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Reduction in the number of vulnerabilities detected over time.
- No critical vulnerabilities left unaddressed for more than 30 days.
- 100% completion rate of scheduled tests.
- Compliance with Article 4(2) criteria in all tests.
- Successful remediation of gaps identified in gap analyses.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Maintain detailed records of all tests, including methodologies, findings, and remediation actions.
- Use GRC platforms like RSA Archer to document and manage evidence.
- Regularly update the Digital Operational Resilience Plan (DORP) to reflect changes and improvements.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- Assign a dedicated project team with clear roles and responsibilities.
- Establish a centralized repository for all documentation and evidence.
- Develop a detailed project timeline with milestones for each testing activity.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- Use only tools and vendors with a proven track record and necessary certifications (e.g., ISO 27001, SOC 2).

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- Set specific dates for each testing activity and assign responsible parties.
- Quarterly review meetings to assess progress and adjust timelines as necessary.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- Adopt a risk-based approach to testing, focusing on systems critical to business operations first.
- Use risk assessment results to prioritize remediation efforts.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- Create a compliance matrix that maps each testing activity to the relevant sections of Article 24 and Article 4(2).

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- Engage stakeholders early in the process for buy-in and to understand their needs.
- Conduct a pilot test of the implementation plan on a small scale to gather initial feedback and make necessary adjustments.
- Establish a continuous feedback loop with the project team and stakeholders to refine the plan as it is executed.
- Review the effectiveness of the implementation post-execution and document lessons learned for future sprints.
