# Sprint 3 - Test Plan Review Feedback

## General Feedback
Overall, the test plan for Sprint 3 is comprehensive and well-structured. It covers a range of important areas, including tool integration, testing frequencies, resource allocation, measurable KPIs, and quality standards. The inclusion of industry-standard tools, risk-based prioritization, and compliance mapping is commendable. However, there are areas where the plan could be improved to ensure clarity, efficiency, and alignment with best practices.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

- **Automated Scanning Tools:** It's good to see the latest versions of tools being used. However, it's important to ensure that the integration with the centralized vulnerability management platform is seamless and that the platform is capable of handling inputs from all three tools effectively.

- **Manual Checks:** While updating the manual testing checklist bi-annually is a good practice, consider increasing the frequency of updates to reflect the rapidly changing threat landscape. Additionally, ensure that the manual checks are comprehensive and cover all relevant areas.

- **Remediation Process:** The timelines for addressing vulnerabilities are clear, but it would be beneficial to include a process for re-evaluating the severity of issues over time, as some issues may become more critical if not addressed promptly.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Regular Assessments:** The schedule for assessments is clear, but it would be useful to include a rationale for the chosen frequencies. Also, consider the impact of these assessments on system performance and plan accordingly to minimize disruption.

- **Emergency Assessments:** The definition of a "significant threat landscape change" is a good start, but it should also include other potential triggers such as new vulnerability disclosures relevant to the bank's technology stack.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Vulnerability Assessment Team (VAT):** The composition of the VAT is appropriate. However, consider defining the specific roles and responsibilities within the team to avoid any confusion during the testing process.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **KPIs:** The KPIs are relevant, but it would be beneficial to include benchmarks or targets for each KPI to provide a clear goal for the team.

- **Success Criteria:** The annual progress milestones are a good practice. Ensure that these milestones are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) to facilitate effective tracking and management.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Centralized Repository:** The plan for a centralized repository is crucial for maintaining an audit trail. Ensure that the repository has robust access controls and that the backup and disaster recovery procedures are tested regularly.

## Quality Standards

- **Immediately Actionable Guidance:** The response plan for high-severity findings is essential. Ensure that the plan is detailed and includes specific steps for containment, eradication, and recovery.

- **Industry-standard Tools and Vendors:** The bi-annual review of tools and vendors is a good practice. However, consider establishing criteria for the evaluation of tools and vendors to ensure consistency and objectivity in the review process.

- **Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities:** The assessment cycle should be realistic and consider the team's workload. The role of the project manager is critical, and their responsibilities should be clearly defined.

- **Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks:** The prioritization matrix is a key component of the plan. Ensure that it is not only updated quarterly but also validated against real-world scenarios to test its effectiveness.

- **Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections:** The compliance matrix for DORA regulation is a good inclusion. Make sure that the matrix is easily understandable and actionable for the team members responsible for compliance.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- **Feedback Incorporation:** The establishment of a feedback review committee is a positive step. Ensure that the committee has a diverse representation from different areas of expertise to provide a holistic view of the feedback.

## User Story Implementation

- The risk-based ICT testing approach for the microenterprise user story (US003) is well thought out. However, ensure that the guidance provided to microenterprises is not only clear but also actionable, with specific examples or templates they can follow.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Test Environment:** Ensure that the testing is conducted in an environment that closely mirrors the production environment to obtain accurate results.

- **Stakeholder Communication:** Develop a communication plan to keep all stakeholders informed about the testing process, findings, and remediation efforts.

- **Tool Integration:** Verify that the automated tools are not only up-to-date but also compatible with each other to prevent any integration issues.

- **Training and Awareness:** In addition to bi-annual training for the VAT, consider implementing regular awareness programs for all employees to foster a culture of security.

By addressing these points, the test plan for Sprint 3 can be further refined to ensure a robust and effective security testing process.
