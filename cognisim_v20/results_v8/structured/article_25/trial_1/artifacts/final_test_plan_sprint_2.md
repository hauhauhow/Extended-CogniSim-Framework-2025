# Final Test Plan for Sprint 2

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Automated Scanning Tools**: Utilize Nessus, Qualys, and Rapid7 for automated vulnerability assessments.
- **Manual Checks**: Conduct manual checks using a checklist from the OWASP Testing Guide and CIS Benchmarks.
- **Remediation Process**: Address findings through a remediation process, prioritizing based on severity and tracking to resolution in JIRA.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Regular Assessments**: Perform vulnerability assessments quarterly and before any deployment or redeployment.
- **Emergency Assessments**: Conduct assessments in response to significant threat landscape changes or major patch deployments.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Vulnerability Assessment Team (VAT)**: Comprise of security analysts, a team lead, and a compliance officer.
- **Responsibilities**: The VAT is tasked with conducting assessments, reporting findings, and coordinating remediation efforts.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **KPIs**: Track Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR) critical vulnerabilities, closure percentage within a defined timeframe, and repeat findings.
- **Success Criteria**: Achieve a 90% reduction in high-risk vulnerabilities year-over-year and address all critical vulnerabilities within 30 days.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Centralized Repository**: Maintain all documents in a secure, centralized repository with access controls.
- **Documentation Includes**: Detailed reports, remediation plans, and change logs.
- **Retention Policy**: Comply with regulatory requirements, retaining documents for a minimum of five years.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- **Action Plan**: Provide the VAT with a detailed plan, including specific vulnerabilities to address in alignment with the current sprint's objectives.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- **Selection Criteria**: Choose tools and vendors based on performance in comparative analyses and prevalence in the financial industry.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- **Assessment Cycle**: Complete each vulnerability assessment cycle within 30 days of initiation.
- **Contingency Plans**: Include provisions for additional resources and overtime if necessary.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- **Prioritization Matrix**: Use a risk matrix to prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity, asset value, and remediation complexity.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- **DORA Regulation**: Map the vulnerability assessment process to specific sections of the DORA regulation for compliance.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

### Feedback Incorporation

- **Feedback Collection**: Distribute a feedback form to stakeholders to gather suggestions for improvement.
- **Success Metrics**: Evaluate the iterative improvement process using stakeholder satisfaction scores and the reduction in audit findings.

## Conclusion

This implementation plan builds on the feedback from Sprint 1, providing detailed, actionable steps to align all processes with the bank's objectives and regulatory requirements. It emphasizes continuous improvement and stakeholder engagement to ensure the vulnerability assessment process for CSDs and CCPs is not only efficient and effective but also compliant.
