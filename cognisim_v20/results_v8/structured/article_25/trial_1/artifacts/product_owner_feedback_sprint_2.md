# Feedback on Final Test Plan for Sprint 2

## General Feedback
Overall, the test plan for Sprint 2 is well-structured and covers a comprehensive range of activities necessary for a thorough vulnerability assessment process. The inclusion of both automated and manual checks, the clear definition of roles and responsibilities, and the focus on compliance with regulatory requirements are commendable. The plan also appropriately emphasizes the importance of iterative improvement and stakeholder engagement.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

#### Automated Scanning Tools
- **Feedback**: The selection of Nessus, Qualys, and Rapid7 is appropriate. However, ensure that the tools are configured correctly to avoid false positives and that they are updated to the latest versions to detect recent vulnerabilities.

#### Manual Checks
- **Feedback**: Manual checks are critical for areas that automated tools might miss. Ensure that the checklist is kept up-to-date with the latest OWASP Testing Guide and CIS Benchmarks.

#### Remediation Process
- **Feedback**: Prioritization based on severity is essential. However, it would be beneficial to include a timeline for addressing non-critical vulnerabilities as well.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

#### Regular Assessments
- **Feedback**: Quarterly assessments are a good practice, but consider the possibility of more frequent scans for critical systems or after significant changes to the infrastructure.

#### Emergency Assessments
- **Feedback**: Define what constitutes a "significant threat landscape change" to avoid ambiguity and ensure timely response.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

#### Vulnerability Assessment Team (VAT)
- **Feedback**: Clearly defined roles are good. Ensure that there is a process for the VAT to stay current with the latest security trends and training.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

#### KPIs
- **Feedback**: The KPIs are relevant and measurable. Consider adding a KPI for the percentage of false positives, as this can impact the efficiency of the process.

#### Success Criteria
- **Feedback**: The success criteria are ambitious and clear. Ensure that there are interim milestones to track progress throughout the year.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

#### Centralized Repository
- **Feedback**: The centralized repository is a good practice. Ensure that backup and disaster recovery procedures are also in place.

### Quality Standards

#### Immediately Actionable Guidance
- **Feedback**: The action plan should be flexible to accommodate findings that may require immediate attention outside of the sprint's objectives.

#### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors
- **Feedback**: While industry prevalence is important, also consider the specific needs and context of the bank when selecting tools.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

#### Assessment Cycle
- **Feedback**: The 30-day cycle is reasonable, but ensure that this timeline is feasible given the team's capacity and other commitments.

#### Contingency Plans
- **Feedback**: Contingency plans are important. Clarify the triggers for enacting these plans and the process for mobilizing additional resources.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

#### Prioritization Matrix
- **Feedback**: The prioritization matrix is a good tool. Ensure that it is consistently applied and reviewed for relevance.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

#### DORA Regulation
- **Feedback**: Mapping to DORA is crucial for compliance. Ensure that the mapping is detailed and that any updates to DORA are reflected promptly in the assessment process.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

### Feedback Incorporation
- **Feedback**: Gathering feedback is a good practice. Additionally, consider implementing a formal process for reviewing and actioning the feedback in a timely manner.

## Conclusion
The test plan is robust and sets a strong foundation for the vulnerability assessment process. It is recommended to review the feedback provided and incorporate it into the plan to enhance its effectiveness and ensure that it remains aligned with the bank's objectives and regulatory requirements.
