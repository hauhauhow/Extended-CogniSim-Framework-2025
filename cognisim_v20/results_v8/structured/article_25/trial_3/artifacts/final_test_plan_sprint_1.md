# Final Test Plan - Sprint 1

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** 
  - Tools: Utilize Qualys or Rapid7 for automated scanning.
  - Schedule: Monthly scans and manual penetration testing semi-annually.

- **Open Source Analyses:** 
  - Tools: Deploy Black Duck or WhiteSource to scan for open-source vulnerabilities and license compliance.
  - Schedule: Weekly automated scans.

- **Network Security Assessments:** 
  - Tools: Use Cisco Stealthwatch for continuous monitoring.
  - Schedule: Conduct formal assessments quarterly.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** 
  - Monthly automated scans; semi-annual penetration testing.

- **Open Source Analyses:** 
  - Weekly automated scans.

- **Network Security Assessments:** 
  - Continuous monitoring; quarterly formal assessments.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Cybersecurity Team:** 
  - Responsibilities: Conducts tests, analyzes results, and implements fixes.
  - Roles: Security Analysts, Penetration Testers, and Compliance Officers.

- **IT Department:** 
  - Responsibilities: Supports the cybersecurity team with system access and patch management.

- **Compliance Department:** 
  - Responsibilities: Ensures testing aligns with Article 4(2) criteria and maintains documentation.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Reduction in the number of critical vulnerabilities year-over-year.
- 100% completion rate of scheduled tests.
- Mean time to remediate critical vulnerabilities less than 30 days.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Use a GRC platform like RSA Archer to document all tests, findings, and remediation actions.
- Maintain an audit trail with timestamps, test results, and sign-offs from responsible parties.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- Assign a Project Manager to oversee the implementation of the testing programme.
- Develop a detailed project plan with concrete milestones and deliverables for each type of test.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- Qualys/Rapid7 for vulnerability assessments.
- Black Duck/WhiteSource for open source analyses.
- Cisco Stealthwatch for network security assessments.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- Project kickoff within two weeks of plan approval.
- Monthly reporting on KPIs to the Compliance Department.
- Quarterly reviews of the testing programme effectiveness.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- Adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for prioritizing remediation based on risk assessment.
- Use CVSS scores to prioritize vulnerabilities.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- Document how each test meets the criteria set out in Article 4(2) in the GRC platform.
- Ensure that the Compliance Department reviews and approves the compliance mapping.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

Given that there is no feedback from the previous sprint, the implementation plan will focus on ensuring high-quality standards and thorough documentation to facilitate future feedback and improvements. The plan will be reviewed by the Product Owner and stakeholders at the end of each testing cycle to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments. This iterative process will ensure continuous improvement and alignment with the evolving regulatory environment and technological landscape.
