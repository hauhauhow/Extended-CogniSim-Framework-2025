# Final Test Plan for Sprint 3: Risk-Based ICT Testing for Microenterprises

## Introduction

This document outlines the final test plan for User Story 003 (US003), focusing on the implementation of a risk-based ICT testing framework specifically designed for microenterprises. The plan includes specific execution procedures, testing frequencies, resource allocation, measurable KPIs, documentation processes, quality standards, compliance mapping, and critical instructions for iterative improvement.

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools
- **DAST Frequency**: Dynamic application security testing (DAST) will be conducted bi-monthly for critical applications using tools such as OWASP ZAP or IBM AppScan.
- **Penetration Testing Scope**: Penetration tests and red team exercises will encompass all internet-facing applications, core banking systems, and customer data repositories.
- **Ad-hoc Scans Management**: A risk-based decision matrix will be utilized for ad-hoc scans, employing a tool like Qualys for prioritization and management, focusing on newly discovered vulnerabilities and recent code deployments.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules
- **Contingency Plans**: An incident response plan will be developed and tested semi-annually through tabletop exercises.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions
- **RACI Matrix Updates**: The RACI matrix will be reviewed quarterly and after any significant project milestone or team change to ensure clarity and currency of roles and responsibilities.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria
- **Performance Metrics**: Key performance metrics such as response time, throughput, and error rates will be established with set thresholds to identify when performance is impacted by security measures.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes
- **Audit Trail Retention**: Audit trails will be maintained for a minimum of five years or as required by regulatory standards, ensuring secure storage and easy retrieval for audit purposes.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance
- **Training for All Stakeholders**: The training program will be extended to include developers, IT operations, and management, focusing on secure coding practices, incident response, and risk management.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors
- Tools such as OWASP ZAP, IBM AppScan for DAST, Qualys for vulnerability management, and Tenable Nessus for penetration testing will be utilized.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities
- **Post-Test Analysis**: Two weeks will be allocated following each testing cycle for analysis and reporting, ensuring findings are documented and remediation plans are in place.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks
- **Off-cycle Reviews**: Criteria for off-cycle risk reviews will be established, such as significant industry threats, breaches in similar institutions, or major software updates.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections
- **Compliance Matrix**: A compliance matrix will be created with clear references to DORA regulations, mapping each testing activity to the relevant article sections, and providing guidance for stakeholders to understand their obligations.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

### Feedback Loop
- **Feedback Collection**: A structured feedback collection process will be implemented post-testing, using surveys and interviews.
- **Feedback Analysis**: Feedback will be analyzed quarterly to identify trends and areas for improvement.
- **Feedback Implementation**: A dedicated team will be assigned to implement feedback, with a timeline for each action item and a follow-up review to assess the effectiveness of the changes made.

### Additional Recommendations

### Integration with Development Processes
- **CI/CD Pipeline Monitoring**: The impact of security testing on CI/CD pipelines will be continuously monitored, using metrics such as deployment frequency and lead time for changes, to ensure no bottlenecks are introduced.

### Training and Awareness
- **Training Effectiveness Metrics**: Knowledge retention will be measured using pre- and post-training quizzes. Annual surveys will be conducted to gauge the effectiveness of monthly awareness sessions and adjust content accordingly.

## User Story: Risk-Based ICT Testing for Microenterprises

- **Strategic Planning**: A risk-based ICT testing framework will be developed, tailored to the needs and capabilities of microenterprises.
- **Resource Scale and Time Allocation**: Testing activities will be prioritized based on the criticality of information assets and services, with resources and time allocated proportionately.
- **Urgency and Type of Risk**: A risk assessment matrix will be used to evaluate the urgency and type of risks faced by the microenterprise, focusing on high-impact and high-probability events.
- **Calculated Risk Taking**: Guidance on risk acceptance and mitigation strategies will be provided, enabling microenterprises to make informed decisions about the level of risk they are willing to accept.
