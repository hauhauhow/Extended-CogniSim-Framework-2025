# Sprint 1 Test Plan Feedback

## General Feedback

The test plan for Sprint 1 is comprehensive and covers a wide range of security testing aspects. It is well-structured and includes specific tools, testing frequencies, role definitions, KPIs, and quality standards. However, there are areas where the plan could be improved to ensure clarity, efficiency, and alignment with the team's capabilities and the organization's strategic goals.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

- **Vulnerability Assessments:**
  - Feedback: Ensure that manual validation of findings is clearly defined and assigned to specific team members to avoid ambiguity.
  - Action: Clarify the process for manual validation and assign responsibilities.

- **Open Source Analyses:**
  - Feedback: Consider the integration of these tools into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure real-time analysis and quicker response to vulnerabilities.
  - Action: Evaluate the feasibility of integrating Black Duck or WhiteSource into the CI/CD pipeline.

- **Network Security Assessments:**
  - Feedback: Define the criteria for selecting external vendors and the process for their engagement to maintain transparency and accountability.
  - Action: Document the vendor selection process and criteria.

- **Gap Analyses:**
  - Feedback: Specify how the findings from gap analyses will be addressed and by whom.
  - Action: Develop a remediation plan for addressing gaps identified.

- **Physical Security Reviews:**
  - Feedback: Include a timeline for when the contracted firm will provide their assessments and the expected deliverables.
  - Action: Add specific timelines and deliverables to the contract terms with the physical security firm.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- Feedback: The annual frequency for some tests may not be sufficient given the rapidly changing threat landscape. Consider increasing the frequency of certain critical tests.
- Action: Review and adjust the testing frequencies for critical tests such as source code reviews and penetration testing.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- Feedback: The role of the CISO appears to be too broad. Specific responsibilities during the testing phases should be outlined.
- Action: Detail the CISO's responsibilities during each phase of the testing programme.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Feedback: While the KPIs are clear, they could benefit from being more specific, particularly in terms of defining what constitutes a 'critical' vulnerability.
- Action: Define 'critical' vulnerabilities and establish more granular KPIs.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Feedback: The process for updating testing procedures is mentioned, but it lacks a defined review cycle.
- Action: Establish a regular review cycle for testing procedures and document the process.

## Quality Standards

- Feedback: The plan mentions adherence to ISO/IEC 27001 standards but does not specify how compliance will be verified.
- Action: Outline a process for regular ISO/IEC 27001 compliance checks.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- Feedback: The plan acknowledges the absence of feedback from the previous sprint but does not provide a mechanism for ensuring feedback is captured and acted upon in future sprints.
- Action: Implement a formal feedback loop with stakeholders and document how feedback will be incorporated into the test plan.

## Conclusion

Overall, the test plan is robust and well thought out. The feedback provided aims to refine the plan further, ensuring that it is actionable, aligned with best practices, and adaptable to the changing environment. By addressing the points mentioned, the team can enhance the effectiveness of the testing programme and better meet the organization's security and compliance needs.
