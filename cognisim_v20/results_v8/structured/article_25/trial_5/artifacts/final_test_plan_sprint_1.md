# Final Test Plan - Sprint 1

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** Utilize Qualys or Rapid7 for automated scanning and manual validation of findings.
- **Open Source Analyses:** Implement Black Duck or WhiteSource to scan for open source vulnerabilities and license compliance.
- **Network Security Assessments:** Engage with external vendors like FireEye or Palo Alto Networks for comprehensive network evaluations.
- **Gap Analyses:** Use frameworks like COBIT or NIST to identify gaps in current practices versus industry standards.
- **Physical Security Reviews:** Contract a specialized firm to conduct on-site assessments of data centers and offices.
- **Questionnaires:** Develop and distribute security questionnaires via GRC platforms like RSA Archer or MetricStream.
- **Scanning Software Solutions:** Deploy Nessus or OpenVAS for regular system and network scans.
- **Source Code Reviews:** Integrate automated tools like Veracode or Checkmarx into the CI/CD pipeline for real-time code analysis.
- **Scenario-Based Tests:** Use tabletop exercises facilitated by tools like Cyberbit or XM Cyber.
- **Compatibility Testing:** Automate using Selenium or TestComplete.
- **Performance Testing:** Implement LoadRunner or JMeter for stress and load testing.
- **End-to-End Testing:** Utilize Tricentis Tosca for comprehensive E2E testing.
- **Penetration Testing:** Engage certified ethical hackers for manual testing, supplemented by tools like Metasploit or Core Impact.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- Quarterly for vulnerability assessments, network security assessments, and scanning software solutions.
- Bi-annually for open source analyses, gap analyses, and physical security reviews.
- Annually for source code reviews, scenario-based tests, compatibility testing, performance testing, end-to-end testing, and penetration testing.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):** Overall accountability for the testing programme.
- **Security Analysts:** Conduct vulnerability assessments, open source analyses, and network security assessments.
- **Compliance Officers:** Oversee gap analyses and ensure adherence to Article 4(2) criteria.
- **Physical Security Manager:** Coordinate physical security reviews.
- **IT Operations Team:** Support compatibility, performance, and end-to-end testing.
- **Ethical Hackers (internal/external):** Execute penetration testing.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Reduction in the number of critical vulnerabilities year-over-year.
- 100% completion rate of scheduled tests.
- Mean time to remediate critical findings within 30 days.
- No repeat findings in subsequent tests.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Maintain detailed records of all tests, findings, and remediation actions in a centralized GRC platform.
- Ensure all documentation is timestamped, version-controlled, and signed off by relevant stakeholders.
- Regularly review and update testing procedures to reflect changes in the threat landscape and regulatory requirements.

## Quality Standards

- **Immediately Actionable Guidance:**
  - Assign a project manager to oversee the implementation of the testing programme, with clear milestones and deliverables.
  - Develop a detailed project plan with specific tasks, owners, and deadlines.

- **Industry-standard Tools and Vendors:**
  - Select tools and vendors based on industry recognition, such as Gartner's Magic Quadrant, and ensure they comply with ISO/IEC 27001 standards.

- **Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities:**
  - Establish a timeline with key milestones, including procurement of tools, training of personnel, and execution of tests.
  - Define clear roles and responsibilities for all team members involved in the testing programme.

- **Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks:**
  - Prioritize testing activities based on a risk assessment that considers the criticality of systems, data sensitivity, and threat intelligence.

- **Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections:**
  - Develop a compliance matrix that maps each testing activity to the relevant sections of Article 24 and Article 4(2), ensuring full coverage of regulatory requirements.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

Given the absence of feedback from the previous sprint, the implementation plan will be reviewed and refined through continuous engagement with stakeholders, including the Product Owner, to ensure alignment with the bank's strategic objectives and regulatory expectations. Regular sprint reviews will be conducted to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments to the plan.
