# Feedback on Final Test Plan - Sprint 3

## General Feedback

The test plan for Sprint 3 is comprehensive and well-structured, covering a range of testing strategies, tools, and procedures. It is evident that the team has put significant thought into the security testing aspects, aligning with industry standards and compliance requirements. The inclusion of both automated and manual testing, along with a clear definition of roles and responsibilities, sets a strong foundation for the security testing process.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

- **Automated Vulnerability Scanning Tools:**
  - It's good to see a primary and alternative tool listed. However, ensure that the team is trained and prepared to switch to the alternative tool without significant delays in the event of a service disruption.

- **Manual Penetration Testing:**
  - The criteria for vendor selection are appropriate. It would be beneficial to include a timeline for vendor engagement and ensure that contractual agreements allow for the flexibility required in response to emerging threats.

- **Prioritization of Vulnerabilities:**
  - The use of CVSS v3.1 is standard practice, and the custom risk matrix is a great addition. Ensure that the matrix is regularly updated to reflect the evolving threat landscape and business priorities.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Automated Vulnerability Scans:**
  - The frequency of scans is well-defined. Consider specifying the criteria for what constitutes a 'critical' versus 'non-critical' system for clarity.

- **Manual Penetration Tests:**
  - The schedule for manual tests is clear. Ensure that the process for initiating ad-hoc tests is streamlined and documented.

- **Open Source Analysis:**
  - Integration into the CI/CD pipeline is commendable. Make sure there are clear guidelines on how to handle issues that cannot be immediately resolved.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Backup Personnel:**
  - Quarterly drills are a good practice. Ensure that there is documentation on the performance of these drills and any lessons learned are incorporated into training.

- **Security Team Structure:**
  - Clearly defined roles are essential. It would be helpful to include a RACI matrix to further clarify responsibilities and decision-making authority.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **Remediation Timelines:**
  - The timelines are aggressive and show a commitment to security. However, ensure that these are realistic and that the team has the necessary resources to meet them.

- **User Awareness:**
  - The KPIs for user awareness are a good start. Consider adding more granular metrics to track improvements over time.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Compliance Management Platform:**
  - RSA Archer is a robust choice. Ensure that all team members are trained on how to use the platform effectively.

## Quality Standards

- The standards set are high and align with best practices. It would be beneficial to include a process for regularly reviewing and updating these standards to ensure they remain relevant.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- **Feedback Mechanism:**
  - The digital feedback form is a great tool. Ensure that it is user-friendly and that the team is encouraged to provide honest feedback.

- **Feedback Review and Action Process:**
  - The action plan from feedback is crucial. Make sure that the follow-up reviews are scheduled and that there is accountability for implementing changes.

## Additional Recommendations

- The additional recommendations are well-thought-out. Ensure that these drills and training sessions are not only conducted but also documented and reviewed for continuous improvement.

## User Story

- The scaling down for microenterprises is a thoughtful inclusion. Ensure that there is guidance available for these smaller operations to implement the plan effectively.

## Action Items

- [ ] Clarify criteria for 'critical' vs. 'non-critical' systems.
- [ ] Document the process for ad-hoc manual penetration tests.
- [ ] Create a RACI matrix for security team roles.
- [ ] Review remediation timelines for feasibility.
- [ ] Develop more granular user awareness metrics.
- [ ] Train all team members on RSA Archer.
- [ ] Ensure the feedback form is user-friendly.
- [ ] Schedule and document follow-up reviews for feedback action plans.
- [ ] Regularly review and update drills and training sessions for effectiveness.
- [ ] Provide implementation guidance for microenterprises.

Overall, the test plan is robust and sets a high standard for security testing. With the above feedback and action items addressed, the plan will be even stronger and more effective.
