# Final Test Plan: Sprint 1

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** 
  - Automated scanning tools such as Qualys or Tenable Nessus will be used for weekly scans.
  - Manual penetration testing will be conducted semi-annually by an internal red team or a third-party service.

- **Open Source Analyses:** 
  - Tools like Black Duck or WhiteSource will be implemented to continuously monitor and manage open source security and license compliance risks.

- **Network Security Assessments:** 
  - Quarterly network security assessments will be conducted using tools like SolarWinds or Cisco Stealthwatch for traffic analysis and anomaly detection.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** 
  - Weekly automated scans.
  - Semi-annual manual tests.

- **Open Source Analyses:** 
  - Continuous monitoring with monthly review meetings.

- **Network Security Assessments:** 
  - Quarterly assessments with immediate follow-up on identified issues.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO):** 
  - Oversight of the entire program.

- **Security Analysts:** 
  - Conduct and review automated scans and assessments.

- **Red Team:** 
  - Execute manual penetration tests.

- **Compliance Officer:** 
  - Ensure testing aligns with Article 4(2) criteria and maintain documentation.

- **IT Operations Team:** 
  - Remediate identified vulnerabilities and issues.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Reduction in the number of critical vulnerabilities year-over-year.
- Time to remediate critical vulnerabilities.
- Percentage of compliance with Article 4(2) criteria.
- Number of successful/unsuccessful breach attempts detected during testing.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Maintain detailed records of all tests, findings, and remediation actions in a centralized compliance management platform like RSA Archer or ServiceNow GRC.
- Regularly update the risk register and ensure an audit trail is available for each identified risk and its mitigation steps.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- Assign a project manager to oversee the implementation of the testing program, with clear deadlines for each type of test.
- Establish a communication plan to report findings to stakeholders and regulatory bodies as required.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- Use Gartner's Magic Quadrant to select top-rated vendors for vulnerability management, network security, and compliance management.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- Within 30 days, finalize the selection of tools and vendors.
- Within 60 days, complete the first round of vulnerability assessments.
- Within 90 days, have the open source analysis tool fully operational.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- Adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for prioritizing identified risks based on their potential impact on the bank's operations.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- Create a compliance matrix that maps each testing activity to the relevant sections of Article 24 and Article 4(2), ensuring all legal requirements are met.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

As there was no feedback from the previous sprint, the focus will be on ensuring the quality and completeness of the implementation plan. The plan will be reviewed by the Product Owner and other stakeholders to gather feedback for continuous improvement. Regular sprint retrospectives will be conducted to identify any areas of the plan that can be refined or require additional detail.
