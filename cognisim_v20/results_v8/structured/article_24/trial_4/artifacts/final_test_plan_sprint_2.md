# Final Test Plan: Sprint 2

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Risk Assessment Tool**: Utilize RSA Archer for continuous risk identification and evaluation of ICT systems.
- **Automated Testing Suites**: Implement Selenium for routine checks and IBM Rational Quality Manager for test management.
- **Incident Management Software**: Adopt ServiceNow for incident management and response coordination.
- **Tool Selection Justification**: Rational Quality Manager and JIRA are selected for their integration capabilities and robust reporting features.
- **Integration**: Integrate all tools into our CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins orchestrating the workflow.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Risk Assessment**: Automated risk assessments are to be conducted quarterly, with comprehensive manual assessments bi-annually.
- **Penetration Testing**: Semi-annual penetration testing is scheduled, with additional tests after significant ICT changes.
- **Red Team Exercises**: Bi-annual exercises are planned, with ad-hoc exercises for major system updates or threats.
- **Scheduling Alignment**: Independent testing activities will align with our bi-weekly sprint cycle, occurring in the second week of each sprint.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **DORT Committee**: Define roles within the committee, including Chairperson, Secretary, and IT, cybersecurity, and business unit representatives.
- **Incident Response Team**: Assign clear roles and ensure authority for critical decision-making, with mandated regular training.
- **DORT Committee Role Clarity**: Specify roles such as Chairperson, Secretary, and Lead Testers, with clear responsibilities.
- **Collaboration Channels**: Establish communication channels between cybersecurity, IT, and development teams.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **KPIs**: Set targets for KPIs, such as MTTD and MTTR to incidents.
- **Success Criteria**: Align success criteria with business objectives, like maintaining system uptime above 99.9% and patching critical vulnerabilities within 48 hours.
- **KPI Targets**: Define targets such as MTTD < 4 hours, MTTR < 12 hours, and addressing 100% of critical vulnerabilities within 24 hours.
- **Success Criteria Alignment**: Maintain system uptime above 99.9% and aim for a 25% year-over-year reduction in security incidents.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Version Control**: Use Git for version control, integrated with the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Change Management**: Implement BMC Remedy for change management, integrated with development and deployment processes.
- **Version Control System**: Mandatory peer reviews for all changes in Git.
- **Change Management Integration**: Utilize ServiceNow for change management to ensure full traceability.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- **Gap Analysis**: Perform a gap analysis with stakeholder input and create a remediation plan with clear ownership and deadlines.
- **Tool Procurement**: Set realistic timelines for procurement, setup, integration, and training.
- **Gap Analysis Execution**: Complete a gap analysis with input from risk management, compliance, and audit departments within the first month of Q3 2025.
- **Tool Procurement Timeline**: Allow 6 weeks for procurement, setup, and integration, targeting completion by Q4 2025.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- **Tool Compliance**: Ensure compliance with ISO/IEC 27001, GDPR, NIST frameworks, and DORA requirements.
- **Vendor Risk Assessment**: Conduct assessments before procurement to verify compliance.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- **Timelines**: Establish project timelines with milestones and specific dates for assessments, testing, and reviews.
- **Responsibilities**: Assign clear owners to each task, documented in a RACI matrix.
- **Replace Placeholder Dates**: Set actual dates for gap analysis completion and tool procurement.
- **Assign Clear Owners**: Designate responsibilities such as the CISO for gap analysis and the Procurement Manager for tool procurement.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- **Prioritization**: Apply the FAIR model to evaluate and prioritize testing activities consistently.
- **Consistent Application**: Use the FAIR model across all testing activities for risk prioritization.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- **Regulatory Alignment**: Maintain and update a compliance matrix that maps testing activities to DORA and other regulations.
- **Quarterly Review**: Schedule a quarterly review to ensure regulatory alignment.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

### Feedback Loop

- **Action Item Tracking**: Log, assign, and track action items from DORT Committee meetings in a project management tool like JIRA.
- **Utilize Asana**: Track action items with clear deadlines and responsible parties.

### Continuous Learning

- **Formal Training Plan**: Develop a training plan for the cybersecurity team with milestones and measurable outcomes, such as certifications or skill assessments.
- **Quarterly Milestones**: Set quarterly milestones for achieving certifications or completing training exercises.
