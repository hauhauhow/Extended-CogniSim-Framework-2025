# Final Test Plan: Sprint 1

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- Establish a Digital Operational Resilience Testing (DORT) Committee with representatives from IT, Risk Management, Compliance, and Business Units.
- Adopt industry-standard tools such as IBM Resilient, RSA Archer, ServiceNow, Tenable Nessus, Qualys, Kali Linux, and Metasploit.
- Implement a combination of penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, code reviews, and threat modeling exercises.
- Adopt industry-standard methodologies such as OWASP, NIST frameworks for cybersecurity, and COBIT for IT governance.
- Utilize automated scanning tools like Nessus for vulnerability scanning, Burp Suite for web application security, and IBM QRadar for SIEM.
- Contract with third-party service providers for independent testing.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- Schedule vulnerability scans and patch management on a weekly basis.
- Conduct penetration testing semi-annually and after any significant change to the IT infrastructure.
- Perform Red Team exercises annually.
- Review and update the DORT programme quarterly.
- Perform quarterly vulnerability scans and after the deployment of new applications or services.
- Schedule monthly automated code reviews and bi-annual manual code reviews.
- Execute threat modeling exercises annually and during the design phase of new projects.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- Appoint a DORT Programme Manager to oversee the initiative.
- Assign dedicated IT security analysts for continuous monitoring and testing.
- Engage external consultants for independent testing and audits.
- Define roles for incident response, including first responders, investigators, and communication officers.
- Allocate a dedicated cybersecurity team responsible for carrying out the testing programme, including security analysts, penetration testers, and compliance officers.
- Ensure collaboration between the cybersecurity team and IT/development teams for remediation and continuous improvement.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Reduction in the number of identified vulnerabilities over time.
- Decrease in incident response time.
- Increase in the number of staff trained in ICT risk management.
- Successful execution of corrective measures within agreed timeframes.
- Number of vulnerabilities identified and remediated.
- Time to remediate critical vulnerabilities.
- Percentage of coverage for code reviews and penetration tests.
- Frequency and severity of security incidents.
- Compliance rate with Articles 25 and 26.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Maintain a DORT programme log in a secure, centralized repository accessible to the DORT Committee.
- Document all testing methodologies, findings, and corrective actions.
- Use tools like DocuSign for audit trail integrity and version control.
- Regularly report to the board and regulatory bodies as required.
- Generate comprehensive reports for each test conducted, outlining findings, impact, and remediation steps.
- Maintain a remediation log to track progress and ensure accountability.
- Document all changes made to the IT environment in a change management system.
- Implement logging mechanisms to provide an audit trail for all testing activities.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- Begin with a gap analysis against the current ICT risk management framework to identify areas for the DORT programme.
- Engage vendors for tool procurement and setup within 30 days.
- Complete initial staff training on the DORT programme within 60 days.
- Contract with vendors like FireEye or CrowdStrike to start the bi-annual penetration testing within the next quarter.
- Set up Nessus scans to run automatically every first Monday of a new quarter.
- Integrate automated code review tools like SonarQube into the CI/CD pipeline within the next two months.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- Use Gartner and Forrester reports to select top-rated vendors for resilience testing tools.
- Ensure all tools comply with ISO/IEC 27001 standards for information security management.
- Deploy IBM QRadar for real-time security monitoring and incident response.
- Subscribe to services like Recorded Future for actionable threat intelligence to inform testing and assessments.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- Appoint the DORT Programme Manager by [specific date].
- Complete tool implementation and staff training by [specific date].
- Conduct the first round of testing by [specific date].
- Schedule the first round of penetration tests for Q3 2025, with the cybersecurity team preparing the scope by the end of Q2.
- Implement automated quarterly scans starting Q2 2025, with the first manual review of results by the end of Q2.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- Adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the FAIR model for prioritizing assets and vulnerabilities.
- Use a risk matrix to categorize and prioritize findings from testing activities.
- Address critical vulnerabilities within 48 hours, high within one week, and medium and low within one month.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- Map each element of the DORT programme to relevant sections of the DORA regulation.
- Ensure documentation explicitly references the DORA articles to facilitate audits.
- Ensure that the testing programme includes scenarios based on real-world events and emerging threats, as per Article 25 requirements.
- Validate that all testing activities are documented and reviewed, with findings reported to management, in line with Article 26.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- The DORT Committee will hold bi-weekly meetings to discuss progress, challenges, and feedback from the team.
- Conduct a review after the first round of testing to evaluate the effectiveness of the tools and methodologies used.
- Gather feedback from IT, development teams, and management to refine the testing programme.
- Compare the bank's testing programme with industry peers to identify areas for improvement.
- Provide ongoing training for the cybersecurity team to stay updated on the latest testing practices and tools.
- Regularly review and incorporate any changes in regulatory requirements to ensure continued compliance.
