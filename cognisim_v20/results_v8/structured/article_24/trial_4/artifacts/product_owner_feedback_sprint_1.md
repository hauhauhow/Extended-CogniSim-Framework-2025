# Sprint 1 Test Plan Feedback

## General Feedback
Overall, the test plan for Sprint 1 is comprehensive and well-structured, covering a wide range of areas necessary for establishing a robust Digital Operational Resilience Testing (DORT) program. The inclusion of industry-standard tools, methodologies, and compliance mapping is commendable. However, there are several areas where the plan could be improved to ensure clarity, feasibility, and alignment with agile principles.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

- **Committee Formation**: The formation of a DORT Committee is a good step. However, ensure that the committee's roles and responsibilities are clearly defined to avoid overlap and confusion.
- **Tools Selection**: While the selection of tools is extensive, it is important to justify the choice of each tool and ensure they integrate well with each other to avoid tool fatigue and inefficiencies.
- **Independent Testing**: Contracting with third-party service providers is a good practice, but criteria for selecting these providers should be outlined to ensure quality and objectivity.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Scheduling**: The schedule for various testing activities is well laid out. However, it would be beneficial to align these activities with the sprint cycle to ensure that testing is continuous and iterative.
- **Red Team Exercises**: While annual Red Team exercises are planned, consider conducting them more frequently if resources allow, especially if significant changes occur in the IT environment.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Role Clarity**: Ensure that the roles defined for incident response and other activities are not only clear but also that the individuals assigned have the necessary training and authority to act effectively.
- **Collaboration**: Emphasize the importance of collaboration between the cybersecurity team and IT/development teams. This should include regular communication channels and shared objectives.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **KPIs**: The KPIs listed are relevant and measurable. However, it would be beneficial to define specific targets for each KPI to measure success more effectively.
- **Success Criteria**: Ensure that the success criteria are aligned with business objectives and that they are realistic and achievable within the given timeframes.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Version Control**: The use of tools like DocuSign for version control is mentioned, but it's important to also have a version control system for the codebase and configuration files.
- **Change Management**: The documentation of changes in a change management system is crucial. Ensure that this system is integrated with the development and deployment processes for traceability.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- **Gap Analysis**: Starting with a gap analysis is a good approach. Ensure that the analysis is thorough and includes input from all relevant stakeholders.
- **Tool Procurement**: The timeline for tool procurement and setup seems aggressive. Make sure that the timeline is realistic and allows for proper setup and integration.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- **Tool Compliance**: While ISO/IEC 27001 compliance is important, also consider other relevant standards and regulations that may apply to the tools and vendors.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- **Timelines**: Specific dates are mentioned as placeholders. Replace these with actual dates to ensure accountability and track progress effectively.
- **Responsibilities**: Assigning responsibilities is key. Ensure that each task has a clear owner and that the responsibilities are understood by all team members.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- **Prioritization**: The adoption of prioritization frameworks is good practice. Ensure that these frameworks are consistently applied across all testing activities.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- **Regulatory Alignment**: The mapping to DORA regulation is essential. Ensure that this mapping is kept up-to-date as regulations evolve.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- **Feedback Loop**: The bi-weekly meetings of the DORT Committee are a good practice. Ensure that action items from these meetings are tracked and addressed promptly.
- **Continuous Learning**: Ongoing training for the cybersecurity team is vital. Consider establishing a formal training plan that includes milestones and measurable outcomes.

## Conclusion
The test plan for Sprint 1 is a solid foundation for the DORT program. By addressing the feedback provided, the plan can be further refined to ensure it is actionable, effective, and aligned with the agile development cycle. Regular reviews and updates to the plan will be necessary to adapt to changing circumstances and to incorporate lessons learned.
