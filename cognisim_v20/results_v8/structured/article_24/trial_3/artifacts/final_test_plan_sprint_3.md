# Final Test Plan - Sprint 3

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- Establish an Issue Management Framework (IMF) and a Testing Operations Team (TOT) to handle logging, tracking, and resolving issues identified during testing.
- Utilize JIRA for issue tracking and automated testing tools such as IBM Rational Quality Manager and Selenium for test management and automated functional testing.
- Implement static code analysis tools like SonarQube and dynamic analysis tools such as OWASP ZAP for security testing.
- Conduct performance testing using LoadRunner or Apache JMeter.
- Implement a centralized dashboard using Tableau and a centralized documentation repository using Confluence, with version control managed through Git.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- Conduct monthly vulnerability assessments and quarterly penetration tests.
- Schedule annual comprehensive tests for all ICT systems and applications supporting critical or important functions.
- Schedule bi-annual comprehensive risk assessments to align with strategic planning cycles.
- Establish a monthly review process to ensure testing schedules align with the evolving risk profile of the bank.
- Implement a rescheduling policy for missed tests, with criteria including natural disasters, critical system outages, or significant operational disruptions.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- Form dedicated teams: Issue Resolution Team (IRT) within the ITU and Testing Operations Team (TOT) by Q2 2025.
- Finalize and publish the RACI matrix by Q2 2025, ensuring clear responsibilities for issue management and testing operations.
- Allocate additional resources to the ITU by Q4 2025 to handle the increased workload from the IMF.
- Assign a Compliance Liaison within the TOT to ensure adherence to DORA and other regulatory requirements.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Track the average time to resolve critical issues, with a target reduction of 15% within the first year.
- Define KPIs such as test coverage (aim for 95%+), defect detection rate, mean time to repair (MTTR), and system uptime post-deployment.
- Measure stakeholder satisfaction through semi-annual surveys, aiming for an 85% satisfaction rate.
- Set a target for a 95% adherence rate to the issue resolution SLAs.
- Include qualitative KPIs like stakeholder satisfaction surveys to be conducted post-testing cycle.
- Set realistic improvement targets based on historical performance and industry standards.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Develop comprehensive documentation for the IMF and testing procedures using Confluence, with version control managed through Git.
- Develop and enforce a documentation standard by Q3 2025, including templates for test plans, reports, and audit trails.
- Implement a retention policy for issue-related records and audit trails, with a minimum duration of 5 years, and establish access controls based on role-based permissions.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- Prioritize the development of the Independent Testing Procedure Manual, with a draft due by Q1 2025 and finalization by Q2 2025.
- Develop an IMF training program for relevant staff, with sessions starting by Q3 2025.
- Provide detailed guidelines for each testing phase, including pre-requisites, execution steps, and post-testing actions.

### Industry-Standard Tools and Vendors

- Evaluate vendors annually, with the next evaluation scheduled for Q1 2026.
- Select vendors based on their ability to meet the bank's specific needs and compliance requirements.
- Conduct annual vendor evaluations to ensure tools align with industry standards and bank requirements.
- Establish criteria for ad-hoc reviews in case of significant performance issues or changes in requirements.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- Develop a risk mitigation plan for implementation delays by Q2 2025.
- Assign the IRT leader and a Project Manager to oversee the timely execution of the IMF and report progress to the DOR Committee monthly.

### Risk-Based Prioritization Frameworks

- Update the NIST and FAIR frameworks in Q1 2026 to align with the bank's strategic planning cycle.
- Utilize these frameworks to prioritize issues based on risk, ensuring that high-risk issues are addressed first.
- Ensure risk assessments are conducted early, by Q1 2025, to inform the development of the testing program.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- Integrate the compliance checklist into the bank's compliance management system by Q4 2025.
- Map each issue management procedure to relevant sections of DORA regulations for easy reference and auditability.
- Integrate the compliance checklist into the bank's Compliance Management System (CMS) by Q3 2025 for real-time visibility and tracking.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

### Incorporating Previous Sprint's Feedback

- Expedite the formation of the DOR Committee and ITU by Q2 2025 for early oversight.
- Advance the integration of testing tools to Q2 2026 to enable effective testing sooner.
- Clarify the RACI matrix timeline and ensure ITU staffing levels are sufficient by conducting a resource gap analysis by Q3 2025.
- Adjust KPIs to be context-specific and include qualitative measures.
- Specify the audit trail maintenance process, including retention policies and access controls, by Q3 2025.
- Develop a clear contingency plan for rescheduling missed tests, with criteria for "unforeseen circumstances" defined by Q3 2025.
- Adjust the ITU staffing levels based on the initial round of testing and feedback by Q4 2025.
- Implement a feedback tracking system to measure the impact of changes made based on previous sprints' feedback.

### User Story: "Follow a Risk-Based Approach for Testing Programme" Implementation Plan

- Ensure that the exclusion of microenterprises from the risk assessment scope is documented and justified in compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Move the initial risk assessment to Q1 2025 to inform the development of the testing program.

## Additional Recommendations

- Review all timelines for feasibility, considering dependencies between tasks.
- Include a change management strategy to address resistance, with a plan developed by Q3 2025.
- Build flexibility into the test plan to adapt to regulatory changes or emerging threats, with a review and adaptation cycle established bi-annually.
- Ensure that the IMF is integrated with the bank's overall risk management framework for a holistic approach to issue management.
- Assess resource constraints and plan for skilled personnel recruitment or training as needed.
- Develop a change management strategy by Q3 2025 to address potential resistance and ensure smooth adoption of new processes and tools.
- Build flexibility into the test plan to adapt to external factors such as regulatory changes or emerging threats, with a semi-annual review process starting in Q3 2025.
