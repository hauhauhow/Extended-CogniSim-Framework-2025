# Feedback on Final Test Plan - Sprint 2

## General Feedback

Overall, the test plan is comprehensive and well-structured, with clear milestones and deliverables. It demonstrates a strong understanding of the requirements for establishing a robust testing framework within the organization. The inclusion of industry-standard tools, risk-based approaches, and compliance mapping is commendable. However, there are areas where the plan could be improved to ensure clarity, feasibility, and alignment with best practices.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

- The formation of the DOR Committee and ITU is a critical step. Ensure that the committee's formation is expedited to provide oversight as early as possible.
- The timeline for developing the DOR Testing Policy seems extended. Consider moving this to an earlier quarter to allow more time for implementation and refinement.
- The integration of testing tools by Q3 2026 may delay the ability to conduct effective testing. Evaluate the possibility of advancing this timeline.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- The plan for risk assessments, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing is well-defined. However, ensure that the frequency of these tests aligns with the risk profile of the bank and industry best practices.
- The contingency plan for rescheduling missed tests should include clear criteria for what constitutes an "unforeseen circumstance."

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- The creation of a RACI matrix is mentioned twice with different deadlines (Q3 2025 and Q2 2025). Clarify and correct the timeline for this deliverable.
- Ensure that the ITU staffing levels are sufficient to meet the testing demands and consider the need for additional resources as the program matures.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- The KPIs are well-chosen, but consider adding qualitative measures such as stakeholder satisfaction or the effectiveness of communication channels.
- The benchmark for a 10% improvement year-over-year may not be realistic in all cases. Set context-specific targets based on historical data and industry benchmarks.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- The use of SharePoint, Confluence, and Git is appropriate. However, ensure that the implementation timeline allows for adequate training and adoption by the relevant teams.
- Consider specifying the process for maintaining the audit trail, including retention policies and access controls.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- The deliverable of the Independent Testing Procedure Manual by Q2 2025 is critical. Ensure that this document is prioritized and that its development is started early in the timeline.

### Industry-Standard Tools and Vendors

- The semi-annual vendor evaluations may be too frequent and could lead to vendor fatigue. Consider annual evaluations with ad-hoc reviews triggered by significant performance issues or changes in requirements.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- The risk mitigation plan for implementation delays should be developed earlier in the process to proactively manage potential delays.

### Risk-Based Prioritization Frameworks

- The plan to update NIST and FAIR frameworks annually is good. Ensure that the updates are scheduled in a way that aligns with the bank's strategic planning cycle.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- The compliance mapping is a strong point of the plan. Ensure that the compliance checklist is integrated into the bank's overall compliance management system for efficiency and visibility.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

### Incorporating Previous Sprint's Feedback

- The feedback incorporation is well-addressed. Ensure that the feedback loop is closed by tracking the implementation of changes and measuring their impact.

### User Story: "Follow a Risk-Based Approach for Testing Programme" Implementation Plan

- The risk-based approach is essential. Ensure that the exclusion of microenterprises from the risk assessment scope is compliant with regulatory requirements and does not introduce undue risk.
- The timeline for the initial risk assessment seems late in the process. Consider moving this forward to inform the development of the testing program more effectively.

## Additional Recommendations

- Ensure that all timelines are feasible and consider the dependencies between different tasks.
- Review the plan for any potential resource constraints, especially around the availability of skilled personnel.
- Include a change management strategy to address the potential resistance and ensure smooth adoption of new processes and tools.
- Consider the impact of external factors such as regulatory changes or emerging threats on the test plan, and build in flexibility to adapt as needed.

In conclusion, the test plan is robust but requires some adjustments to ensure that it is realistic, actionable, and aligned with the organization's capacity for change. By addressing the feedback provided, the plan can be further refined to set the stage for successful implementation.
