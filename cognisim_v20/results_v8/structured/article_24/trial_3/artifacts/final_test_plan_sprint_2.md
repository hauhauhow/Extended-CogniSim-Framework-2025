# Final Test Plan - Sprint 2

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- Form a DOR Committee by Q3 2025, with representatives from IT, Risk Management, Business Continuity, and Compliance.
- Establish an Independent Testing Unit (ITU) within the bank's organizational structure by Q3 2025, with a clear mandate to conduct unbiased testing.
- Develop a comprehensive DOR Testing Policy by Q4 2025, detailing the scope, approach, and methodologies for independent testing, ensuring no conflicts of interest.
- Identify critical ICT systems and assets by involving stakeholders from all departments by Q1 2026.
- Design test scenarios using templates based on real-world examples, to be completed by Q2 2026.
- Integrate industry-standard tools such as IBM Security QRadar (SIEM), Tenable Nessus (Vulnerability Management), Splunk (Data Analysis), and IBM Security Rational Test Workbench for automated testing into existing systems by Q3 2026.
- Conduct training on the MITRE ATT&CK framework by Q4 2026, with refresher courses annually.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- Perform risk assessments semi-annually, vulnerability assessments quarterly, and penetration testing bi-annually.
- Schedule annual full-scale independent testing exercises during the second quarter of each fiscal year.
- Schedule tests during off-peak hours to minimize business disruption, with a contingency plan for rescheduling within two weeks of the original date.
- Implement a contingency plan for rescheduling missed tests, with a buffer period of one month to accommodate unforeseen circumstances.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- Create a RACI matrix by Q3 2025 to clarify roles and responsibilities.
- Allocate a dedicated team for DOR testing, including a Test Manager, Security Analysts, Compliance Officers, and a dedicated team of 10 FTEs to the ITU, including Test Analysts and Cybersecurity Specialists.
- Develop a RACI matrix by Q2 2025 to clarify the responsibilities and communication lines among ITU members.
- Conduct role-specific training sessions bi-annually, with content reviewed annually for relevance.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Establish KPIs such as Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), Mean Time to Respond (MTTR), the number of critical vulnerabilities closed, the number of tests conducted, and the time taken to close findings.
- Set benchmarks for each KPI, aiming for a 10% improvement year-over-year and 100% of identified critical vulnerabilities remediated within 30 days.
- Implement a stakeholder feedback mechanism on remediation effectiveness by Q4 2025.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Audit DOR documentation bi-annually to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Use Microsoft SharePoint and Atlassian Confluence for version control and document management, with implementation by Q2 2026.
- Use Git for version control of all test documentation, ensuring changes are tracked and auditable.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- Milestone deliverables include the formation of the DOR Committee, completion of the DOR Testing Policy, and integration of testing tools.
- By Q2 2025, deliver a detailed Independent Testing Procedure Manual, accessible to all ITU members and relevant stakeholders.
- Make the guidance document available on the bank's intranet by Q4 2025.

### Industry-Standard Tools and Vendors

- Supplement Gartner and Forrester reports with user reviews and case studies for tool selection by Q1 2026.
- Define vendor evaluation criteria focusing on performance, support, and integration capabilities by Q2 2026.
- Conduct semi-annual vendor evaluations using criteria such as performance, support, and integration capabilities.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- Develop a risk mitigation plan for implementation delays by Q3 2025.
- Conduct bi-annual reviews to ensure team members are aware of their responsibilities and expectations.
- Conduct quarterly reviews with each ITU member to reaffirm their responsibilities and discuss any challenges or changes in expectations.

### Risk-Based Prioritization Frameworks

- Update NIST and FAIR frameworks annually to reflect the evolving threat landscape.
- Review and update the prioritization matrix quarterly to maintain relevance.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- Map DORA compliance to other regulations such as GDPR and PSD2 by Q1 2026.
- Create a compliance checklist and review it annually for updates to regulations.
- Create a comprehensive compliance map linking DORA requirements to the bank's policies and procedures by Q4 2025.
- Establish a quarterly compliance checklist review process to incorporate regulatory changes and ensure ongoing compliance.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

### Incorporating Previous Sprint's Feedback

- Include stakeholders from various departments in the risk assessment process to ensure a comprehensive view.
- Provide test scenario templates to guide the ITU in designing effective test cases.
- Ensure tool integration and compatibility, with a focus on interoperability.
- Plan for ITU team training on the MITRE ATT&CK framework by Q1 2026.
- Implement a RACI matrix and specify training content and frequency.
- Establish a feedback loop from stakeholders and conduct regular audits of documentation.
- Define deliverables for each milestone and make guidance documents widely available.
- Combine vendor selection sources and define criteria for regular vendor evaluations.
- Include a risk mitigation plan for implementation delays and ensure clear communication of responsibilities.
- Update risk-based prioritization frameworks annually and review the prioritization matrix bi-annually.
- Regularly review and update the compliance checklist to reflect regulatory changes.
- Define specific metrics that will trigger a review or update of the implementation plan and document the outcomes of sprint retrospectives, ensuring actionable items are tracked to completion.

### User Story: "Follow a Risk-Based Approach for Testing Programme" Implementation Plan

- Conduct an initial risk assessment by Q1 2026 to identify specific risks and criticality of information assets.
- Develop a risk-based testing program that prioritizes assets based on their criticality and the likelihood of threats by Q2 2026.
- Exclude microenterprises from the risk assessment scope, as per the user story requirement.
- Regularly update the risk assessment to reflect the evolving ICT risk landscape, with the first update scheduled for Q3 2026.
- Implement the testing program by Q4 2026, ensuring that it addresses the identified risks and adheres to the DOR Testing Policy.
- Review and refine the testing program annually, with the first review in Q4 2027, to ensure it remains aligned with the bank's risk profile and organizational objectives.
