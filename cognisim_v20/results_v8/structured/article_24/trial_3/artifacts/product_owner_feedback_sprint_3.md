# Feedback on Final Test Plan - Sprint 3

## General Feedback

Overall, the test plan is comprehensive and well-structured, with clear objectives and timelines. The inclusion of industry-standard tools and a focus on compliance and risk-based prioritization are commendable. However, there are areas where the plan could be improved to ensure successful implementation and alignment with the bank's strategic goals.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

- **Issue Management Framework (IMF) and Testing Operations Team (TOT):** The establishment of these teams is a positive step. Ensure that their roles do not overlap and that they have clear, distinct responsibilities.
- **Tools and Dashboards:** The selection of tools such as JIRA, Selenium, and Tableau is appropriate. However, ensure that the integration of these tools is seamless and that the teams are adequately trained to use them.
- **Documentation Repository:** Using Confluence and Git for documentation and version control is a good practice. Ensure that all team members are familiar with these tools and adhere to the documentation standards.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Rescheduling Policy:** The policy for rescheduling missed tests is crucial. It should be detailed enough to cover various scenarios and should be communicated clearly to all stakeholders.
- **Testing Schedules:** While the plan outlines various testing frequencies, it is important to ensure that these are realistic and do not overwhelm the teams. Consider the capacity of the teams when scheduling tests.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **RACI Matrix:** The RACI matrix should be finalized as soon as possible to clarify roles and responsibilities. This will help in avoiding confusion and ensuring accountability.
- **Compliance Liaison:** The role of the Compliance Liaison is critical. Ensure that this person has the necessary authority and knowledge to enforce compliance effectively.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **KPIs and Targets:** The KPIs mentioned are relevant. However, ensure that they are SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) and that the targets set are based on benchmarking against industry standards and historical data.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** While aiming for an 85% satisfaction rate is good, it is also important to have a plan in place to address any dissatisfaction and to continuously improve the stakeholder experience.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Documentation Standard:** The enforcement of a documentation standard is crucial. Ensure that it is comprehensive and that all team members are trained on it.
- **Retention Policy:** The retention policy for records should comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Ensure that the policy is communicated to all relevant parties and that it is enforced strictly.

## Quality Standards

- **Independent Testing Procedure Manual:** The development of this manual is key. Ensure that it is comprehensive and reviewed by subject matter experts.
- **Training Program:** The IMF training program should be comprehensive and include practical exercises to ensure that staff are well-prepared.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- **Integration with CMS:** The integration of the compliance checklist with the CMS should be prioritized to ensure real-time visibility and tracking. Ensure that the CMS is robust and user-friendly.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- **Feedback Tracking System:** Implementing a feedback tracking system is a great initiative. Ensure that it is easy to use and that feedback is acted upon in a timely manner.
- **Contingency Plan for Rescheduling Tests:** The contingency plan should be detailed and should include clear criteria for what constitutes "unforeseen circumstances."

## Additional Recommendations

- **Change Management Strategy:** The development of a change management strategy is critical to ensure buy-in from all stakeholders. This should include communication plans, training, and support structures.
- **Flexibility in the Test Plan:** Building flexibility into the test plan is important. Ensure that there is a clear process for making adjustments and that these adjustments are communicated to all stakeholders.
- **Resource Constraints:** Assessing resource constraints is important. Ensure that there is a plan in place for recruiting or training skilled personnel to avoid bottlenecks.

## Conclusion

The test plan is well thought out and addresses many key areas necessary for successful testing operations. However, by incorporating the feedback provided, the plan can be further refined to ensure that it is realistic, actionable, and aligned with the bank's strategic objectives. It is important to maintain a focus on clear communication, training, and adherence to compliance requirements throughout the implementation of the test plan.
