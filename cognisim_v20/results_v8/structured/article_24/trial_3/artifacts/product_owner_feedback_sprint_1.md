# Sprint Review Feedback: Final Test Plan for Sprint 1

## General Feedback
Firstly, I want to commend the team on the comprehensive nature of the Test Plan. The attention to detail, the inclusion of industry-standard frameworks, and the clear delineation of roles and responsibilities are all indicative of a well-thought-out approach to Digital Operational Resilience (DOR). However, as we move forward, I would like to offer some specific feedback to ensure that our test plan is not only thorough but also actionable and aligned with our organizational goals.

## Feedback on Implementation Requirements

### Execution Procedures
- The establishment of a DOR Committee and the development of a DOR Testing Policy are excellent starting points. However, it would be beneficial to include a timeline for the formation of the committee and the completion of the policy to ensure accountability.
- When identifying critical ICT systems and assets, consider involving stakeholders from different departments to ensure a holistic view of the organization's risk profile.
- For test scenarios, it would be advantageous to include examples or templates to guide the team in their design process.

### Tools and Methodologies
- The selection of tools is appropriate, but we should also consider the integration of these tools into our existing systems to ensure smooth operation.
- It is important to ensure that the tools selected are not only industry-standard but also compatible with each other to avoid any interoperability issues.
- The adoption of the MITRE ATT&CK framework is commendable. However, we should also plan for training or workshops to ensure that the team is proficient in using this framework.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules
- The testing frequencies are well-defined. However, we should also consider the impact of testing on business operations and plan for testing during off-peak hours if necessary.
- The plan should include a contingency schedule for delayed tests or unforeseen circumstances that could affect the testing timeline.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions
- While roles are defined, it would be beneficial to include a RACI matrix to clarify the responsibilities, accountability, and communication lines among the team members.
- Training is mentioned, but we need to specify the frequency and content of the training sessions to ensure they are relevant and up-to-date.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria
- The KPIs and success criteria are well-defined. However, we should also establish a benchmark or target for each KPI to measure our progress effectively.
- Consider adding a feedback loop from stakeholders on the effectiveness of the remediation actions taken.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes
- The documentation process is thorough, but we should also plan for regular audits of the documentation to ensure its accuracy and completeness.
- Implementing version control is critical, but we should also specify the tools or systems we will use for this purpose.

## Feedback on Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance
- The timelines provided are clear, but we should also include specific deliverables for each milestone to track progress effectively.
- The guidance document is a great initiative, and it should be made accessible to all team members and stakeholders for transparency.

### Industry-Standard Tools and Vendors
- The reliance on Gartner’s Magic Quadrant and Forrester Wave reports is a sound strategy, but we should also consider user reviews and case studies to inform our decisions.
- Regular vendor evaluation is crucial, and we should define the criteria for these evaluations to maintain objectivity.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities
- The implementation timeline is clear, but we should also include a risk mitigation plan in case of delays.
- Responsibility Assignment is mentioned, but we should ensure that each team member is aware of their responsibilities and the expectations from them.

### Risk-Based Prioritization Frameworks
- The adoption of NIST and FAIR is commendable. However, we should also consider how these frameworks will be updated to reflect changes in the threat landscape.
- The prioritization matrix should be reviewed and updated regularly to ensure it remains relevant.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections
- Mapping to DORA is essential, but we should also consider other relevant regulations and standards that may apply to our organization.
- A compliance checklist is a good idea, but we should also plan for regular reviews and updates to this checklist as regulations change.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement
- The plan for iterative improvement is a good start, but we should also include specific metrics or indicators that will trigger a review or update of the implementation plan.
- Regular sprint retrospectives are planned, which is excellent. Ensure that the outcomes of these retrospectives are documented and actionable items are tracked to completion.

## Conclusion
Overall, the Test Plan for Sprint 1 is robust and comprehensive. The feedback provided here is intended to refine the plan further and ensure that it is actionable, measurable, and aligned with our organizational objectives. By addressing these points, we can enhance the quality and effectiveness of our DOR Testing Programme and ensure that we are prepared to meet the challenges of an evolving digital landscape.
