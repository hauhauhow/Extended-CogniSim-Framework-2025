# Final Cumulative Test Plan

## Introduction

This document synthesizes the test plans from three consecutive sprints into a cohesive Final Cumulative Test Plan. It outlines the implementation requirements, quality standards, and critical instructions for iterative improvement to ensure the bank's cybersecurity posture is robust, agile, and compliant with regulatory requirements.

## Implementation Requirements

### Execution Procedures and Tools

- Establish a Digital Operational Resilience Committee (DORC) and an Independent Testing Unit (ITU) with clearly defined responsibilities.
- Develop a dynamic, risk-aligned testing strategy utilizing tools such as Nessus, Metasploit, IBM Security AppScan, OWASP ZAP, Splunk, JIRA, IBM Security Rational Test Workbench, SonarQube, and Fortify.
- Document tool selection rationale, feature comparison, cost-benefit analysis, and alignment with cybersecurity objectives in the bank's knowledge repository.
- Implement a Change Advisory Board (CAB) for oversight of tool selection and testing strategies.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- Conduct vulnerability assessments monthly or quarterly, with penetration testing bi-annually.
- Schedule scenario-based testing exercises annually, with tabletop exercises bi-annually and simulation tools quarterly.
- Define "significant change" in the testing policy document and conduct unscheduled tests in response to such changes or emerging threats.
- Implement a calendar system for test tracking and ensure comprehensive testing of all ICT systems annually.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- Define roles including DORC Chairperson, CISO, Testing Program Manager, Security Analysts, Compliance Officers, IT Auditors, Risk Assessment Lead, Penetration Tester, Incident Response Coordinator, Test Manager, and dedicated Issue Management Teams (IMTs).
- Develop a training matrix and cross-training program on platforms like Confluence or the bank's intranet, including succession plans for critical roles.
- Allocate a cross-functional Rapid Response Team for urgent issues.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Track KPIs such as Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), Respond (MTTR), Remediate (MTTRm), training effectiveness, security posture improvements, and the percentage of critical ICT systems tested.
- Set improvement targets for security posture, such as reducing high-risk issues by 20% year-over-year and achieving 100% coverage of annual tests on ICT systems.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Utilize document management systems like Microsoft SharePoint or a centralized repository with role-based access controls and version control.
- Maintain comprehensive records and an immutable Audit Log of all testing activities, findings, remediation actions, and validation results.
- Conduct bi-annual access control audits and quarterly reviews of the immutable log's security measures.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- Develop detailed project plans with specific tasks, deliverables, and deadlines, including clear, step-by-step remediation guides for common issues.
- Provide training to all relevant staff on their roles and responsibilities within the testing program, with effectiveness criteria and post-training assessments.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- Engage with reputable vendors and regularly evaluate tool performance through reviews and benchmarking against standards like ISO/IEC 27001.
- Establish SLAs with vendors, including performance benchmarks, and develop contingency plans for alternative tools and vendors.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- Set a deadline for the DORC to be fully operational and update the Gantt chart bi-weekly, reflecting changes in timelines or responsibilities.
- Include milestones for reviewing and updating the Issue Management Strategy and test plan in the Gantt chart, with semi-annual frequency and assigned responsibilities.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- Adopt a risk-based approach using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for prioritizing testing activities and issues.
- Conduct annual reviews to ensure the framework's principles are embedded in the bank's culture.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- Map each element of the testing program to relevant sections of Article 4(2), Articles 25, and 26.
- Maintain a compliance cross-reference matrix that maps testing activities and issues to specific regulatory requirements, updated with each regulatory change.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- Review and validate the implementation plan with the Product Owner and relevant stakeholders.
- Establish a feedback loop with the testing teams, end-users, and stakeholders for continuous insights and refinement.
- Schedule mid-point review sessions after each sprint and bi-annual lessons learned sessions with IMTs, IT staff, and other relevant personnel.
- Incorporate feedback and lessons learned from each testing cycle to enhance methodologies, tools, and processes.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Agile Alignment:** Adopt agile methodologies within the ITU, ensuring that testing plans can evolve with the project lifecycle.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Increase stakeholder engagement frequency to monthly meetings to ensure continuous alignment with business objectives and user needs.
- **Tool Integration:** Ensure all tools integrate into the bank's existing systems, using APIs where possible to streamline workflows and data sharing.
- **Training and Awareness:** Expand the training program bank-wide, with mandatory security awareness training for all employees and specialized training for the ITU.
- **Performance Metrics:** Develop granular performance metrics for the testing program, such as the average time to set up and execute a test, aiming for a 10% efficiency improvement year-over-year.

## Conclusion

This Final Cumulative Test Plan represents a comprehensive approach to establishing and maintaining the bank's cybersecurity posture. By incorporating feedback from previous sprints and adhering to detailed implementation requirements and quality standards, the bank will ensure continuous improvement in its cybersecurity measures and compliance with regulatory requirements. Regular reviews and updates based on real-world outcomes and evolving threats will further enhance the bank's resilience against cyber threats.
