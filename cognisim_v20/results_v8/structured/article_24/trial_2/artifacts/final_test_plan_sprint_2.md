# Final Test Plan - Sprint 2

## Implementation Requirements

### Execution Procedures and Tools

- Establish a Digital Operational Resilience Committee (DORC) and an Independent Testing Unit (ITU) with clearly defined responsibilities.
- Implement a dynamic testing strategy with tools such as Nessus, IBM Security AppScan, OWASP ZAP, and Splunk.
- Document tool selection rationale in DORC and ITU meeting minutes and risk assessment reports.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- Conduct vulnerability assessments monthly or quarterly and penetration testing bi-annually.
- Additional testing triggered by major system updates, significant changes in threat intelligence, or security incidents.
- Define "significant change" in the testing policy document, with examples and thresholds for action.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- Assign roles such as Risk Assessment Lead, Penetration Tester, Incident Response Coordinator, Test Manager, Security Analysts, and Compliance Officers.
- Develop a training matrix and cross-training program to maintain resilience and prevent knowledge silos.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- KPIs include time to detect/respond to vulnerabilities, percentage of critical vulnerabilities remediated, and percentage of reoccurring vulnerabilities.
- Success criteria include no critical vulnerabilities unaddressed for more than 48 hours and less than 5% of high-risk vulnerabilities remaining unaddressed after 30 days.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Utilize a document management system like Microsoft SharePoint with role-based access controls.
- Maintain an immutable log of all testing activities, protected against unauthorized modifications.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- Provide detailed training modules on risk-based testing with scenario-based exercises.
- Include specific training effectiveness criteria with post-training assessments.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- Regularly evaluate tool performance through vendor reviews and benchmarking against industry standards like ISO/IEC 27001.
- Document performance evaluations and any changes in tool selection.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- Update the Gantt chart bi-weekly, reflecting any changes in timelines or responsibilities.
- Ensure the Gantt chart is accessible to all stakeholders through a central project management platform.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- Integrate the NIST Cybersecurity Framework into daily operations and decision-making processes.
- Conduct annual reviews to ensure the framework's principles are embedded in the bank's culture.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- Maintain a cross-reference matrix that maps testing activities to Article 4(2) requirements and DORA regulations, updated with each regulatory change.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- Define the DORC's and ITU's specific responsibilities and decision-making authority in their charters.
- Include a process for regular updates to the risk assessment methodology in the risk management policy.
- Document the rationale for each selected tool in the risk assessment report and the testing strategy document.
- Specify cross-training requirements in the human resources development plan.
- Add a KPI for remediation effectiveness in the risk management dashboard.
- Audit the document management system's access controls annually and verify the immutable log's integrity bi-annually.
- Incorporate specific training effectiveness criteria into the training program, with assessments conducted after each session.
- Schedule vendor performance evaluations annually, with criteria documented in the vendor management policy.
- Regularly update the Gantt chart and review it in bi-weekly stakeholder meetings.
- Review the integration of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework in annual culture audits.
- Update the compliance matrix in response to regulatory changes, with a review scheduled after each regulatory update.
- Expand the feedback loop to include end-users and stakeholders in post-testing reviews.
- Schedule mid-point review sessions after each sprint, with action items documented and tracked.
- Align the test plan with agile principles, allowing for flexibility in scope and priorities.
- Increase stakeholder engagement frequency to monthly meetings.
- Document tool integration plans in the ICT strategy document.
- Extend the training program to all employees, with an annual security awareness day.
- Develop performance metrics for testing efficiency, such as setup and execution times, and include them in the testing team's dashboard.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Agile Alignment:** Adopt agile methodologies within the ITU, ensuring that testing plans can evolve with the project lifecycle.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Increase stakeholder engagement frequency to monthly meetings to ensure continuous alignment with business objectives and user needs.
- **Tool Integration:** Ensure all tools integrate into the bank's existing systems, using APIs where possible to streamline workflows and data sharing.
- **Training and Awareness:** Expand the training program bank-wide, with mandatory security awareness training for all employees and specialized training for the ITU.
- **Performance Metrics:** Develop granular performance metrics for the testing program, such as the average time to set up and execute a test, aiming for a 10% efficiency improvement year-over-year.
