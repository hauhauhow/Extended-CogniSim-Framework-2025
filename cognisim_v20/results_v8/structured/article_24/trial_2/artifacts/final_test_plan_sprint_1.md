# Final Test Plan: Sprint 1

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

#### Execution Procedures:
- Establish a Digital Operational Resilience Committee (DORC) to oversee the testing program.
- Define a testing strategy aligned with the bank's risk profile and critical ICT systems.
- Develop a testing schedule that includes various types of tests.
- Ensure tests are conducted on all critical ICT systems, including those outsourced to third parties.
- Implement a process for remediation of identified vulnerabilities and deficiencies.

#### Tools:
- Use industry-standard tools such as Nessus, Metasploit, IBM Resilient, Qualys, and Rapid7.
- Utilize GRC platforms like RSA Archer or ServiceNow for documentation and compliance monitoring.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules
- Conduct vulnerability assessments monthly and post-change.
- Perform external penetration testing annually and internal penetration testing quarterly.
- Schedule scenario-based testing exercises annually, with tabletop exercises bi-annually and simulation tools quarterly.
- Review and update the testing program at least once a year or after significant changes.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions
- Assign a DORC Chairperson and a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to oversee the testing program.
- Designate a Testing Program Manager and Security Analysts to handle operations and conduct tests.
- Allocate Compliance Officers to ensure regulatory alignment and IT Auditors to validate the process.
- Involve business continuity and disaster recovery teams in scenario-based testing.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria
- Percentage of critical ICT systems tested within the defined schedule.
- Number of vulnerabilities identified and remediated.
- Time taken to remediate critical vulnerabilities.
- Reduction in the number of incidents due to ICT-related failures.
- Reduction in the number of critical and high vulnerabilities year-over-year.
- Zero missed annual external penetration tests.
- At least 95% staff participation in incident response drills.
- Full compliance with Articles 25 and 26 as measured by GRC platform reports.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes
- Maintain comprehensive records of all tests conducted, including methodologies, findings, and remediation actions.
- Use a centralized document management system for storing all documentation.
- Maintain an immutable log of all testing activities and results.
- Regularly review and update the testing documentation to reflect changes.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance
- Develop a detailed project plan with specific tasks, deliverables, and deadlines.
- Provide training to all relevant staff on their roles and responsibilities within the testing program.
- Assign a project manager to develop a project plan with milestones for the testing program implementation.
- Establish a clear communication plan for stakeholder awareness.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors
- Engage with reputable vendors such as Tenable, Rapid7, IBM, FireEye, and CrowdStrike.
- Ensure all tools are configured and used in accordance with best practices and vendor guidelines.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities
- Set a deadline of three months from the project start date for the DORC to be fully operational.
- Develop a Gantt chart outlining all testing activities, responsible parties, and deadlines.
- Assign clear responsibilities and establish a reporting structure.
- Assign a compliance officer to track progress and report to the CISO.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks
- Adopt a risk-based approach and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework for prioritizing testing activities.
- Use the bank's existing risk assessment framework and a risk register to guide the prioritization process.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections
- Map each element of the testing program to relevant sections of Article 4(2), Articles 25, and 26.
- Create a cross-reference matrix that links testing activities to specific regulatory requirements.
- Document how each testing activity addresses the criteria set forth in the regulation.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- Review and validate the implementation plan with the Product Owner and relevant stakeholders.
- Establish a feedback loop with the testing teams for continuous insights and refinement.
- Schedule a mid-point review session to assess progress and make necessary adjustments.
- Incorporate feedback and lessons learned from each testing cycle to enhance methodologies, tools, and processes.
