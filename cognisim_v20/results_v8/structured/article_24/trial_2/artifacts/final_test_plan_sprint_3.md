# Final Test Plan - Sprint 3

## Implementation Requirements

### Execution Procedures and Tools

- Develop a formal Issue Management Strategy document outlining tool selection rationale, including feature comparison, cost-benefit analysis, and alignment with the bank's cybersecurity objectives.
- Utilize industry-standard tools such as JIRA for issue tracking and IBM Security Rational Test Workbench for automated testing, with custom fields to classify and prioritize issues.
- Implement automated issue detection tools like SonarQube, Fortify, and OWASP ZAP for code quality and security vulnerability scanning.
- Document tool selection rationale in the bank's knowledge repository and establish a Change Advisory Board (CAB) for oversight.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- Define "significant change" with triggers like new product releases, infrastructure updates, regulatory changes, or after a security incident.
- Schedule testing cycles: daily for automated scans, weekly for targeted tests, quarterly for comprehensive manual testing, and annually for all ICT systems.
- Conduct unscheduled tests in response to significant changes or emerging threats and implement a calendar system for test tracking.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- Update the training matrix in real-time on platforms like Confluence or the bank's intranet, including succession plans for critical roles.
- Assign dedicated Issue Management Teams (IMTs) and a Testing Team with clear roles such as Issue Manager, Remediation Specialist, Validation Officer, Compliance Analyst, Testing Coordinator, Test Analysts, Security Specialists, and Quality Assurance Engineers.
- Allocate a cross-functional Rapid Response Team for urgent issues.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- Track KPIs like Mean Time to Detect (MTTD), Respond (MTTR), and Remediate (MTTRm), training effectiveness, and security posture improvements.
- Set improvement targets for security posture, such as reducing high-risk issues by 20% year-over-year and achieving 100% coverage of annual tests on ICT systems.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- Conduct bi-annual access control audits and quarterly reviews of the immutable log's security measures.
- Maintain comprehensive documentation and an Audit Log of all issues, actions, and validation results in a secure, centralized repository with version control.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- Update training modules bi-annually or in response to significant changes, providing clear, step-by-step remediation guides for common issues.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- Establish SLAs with vendors, including performance benchmarks, and develop contingency plans for alternative tools and vendors.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- Include milestones for reviewing and updating the Issue Management Strategy and test plan in the Gantt chart, with semi-annual frequency and assigned responsibilities.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- Utilize the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to prioritize issues and conduct annual actionable reviews, focusing on addressing identified gaps.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- Create a compliance cross-reference matrix that maps issues to specific articles of relevant regulations, ensuring accessibility and integration into the issue management tool.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- Expand the feedback loop to include bi-annual lessons learned sessions with the IMTs, IT staff, and other relevant personnel, documenting outcomes in a Lessons Learned Log.

## Additional Recommendations

### Agile Alignment

- Adopt iterative testing cycles with sprints focused on specific areas, followed by retrospectives to refine processes.

### Stakeholder Engagement

- Organize monthly stakeholder meetings with clear agendas, documenting decisions and tracking implementation in a Decision Log.

### Tool Integration

- Develop a detailed integration plan for new tools, including a timeline, criteria for successful integration, and a rollback plan.

### Training and Awareness

- Customize the bank-wide training program for different roles and departments, implementing metrics to measure the impact on security culture.

### Performance Metrics

- Develop performance metrics that quantify the reduction in risk exposure due to effective issue management, such as the decrease in successful phishing attempts or security breaches.

## Conclusion

By incorporating feedback from the previous sprint and adhering to these detailed implementation requirements and quality standards, the bank will establish robust procedures and policies for issue management that are agile, actionable, and strategically aligned with the bank's objectives. Regular reviews and updates based on real-world outcomes and evolving threats will ensure continuous improvement in the bank's cybersecurity posture.
