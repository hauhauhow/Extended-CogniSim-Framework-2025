# Feedback on Final Test Plan: Sprint 1

## General Feedback
Overall, the test plan is comprehensive and well-structured, covering a wide range of areas essential for ensuring the resilience of the bank's ICT systems. The plan includes a clear definition of roles, responsibilities, and schedules, which is crucial for successful implementation. The use of industry-standard tools and a risk-based prioritization framework aligns with best practices. However, there are areas where the plan could be improved to ensure clarity, effectiveness, and alignment with agile principles.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

#### Execution Procedures:
- The establishment of the Digital Operational Resilience Committee (DORC) is a good strategic move. However, it would be beneficial to define the specific responsibilities and decision-making authority of the DORC to avoid any ambiguity.
- The testing strategy should not only align with the bank's risk profile but also be adaptable to changes in the risk landscape. Consider adding a procedure for regular risk assessment updates.

#### Tools:
- While the list of tools is comprehensive, it is important to ensure that the selection of tools is based on the specific needs of the bank rather than industry popularity. A rationale for each tool's selection should be documented.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules
- The schedule for vulnerability assessments and penetration testing is clear. However, it would be helpful to define the criteria for what constitutes a "significant change" that triggers additional testing.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions
- The roles are well-defined, but it is important to ensure that there is sufficient cross-training among team members to cover absences and prevent knowledge silos.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria
- The KPIs are specific and measurable, which is excellent. However, consider adding a KPI related to the effectiveness of the remediation actions, such as "percentage of reoccurring vulnerabilities."

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes
- The plan for documentation and audit trails is robust. Ensure that the document management system has appropriate access controls and that the immutable log is protected against unauthorized changes.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance
- The guidance provided is actionable, but it would be beneficial to include specific criteria for the training's effectiveness, such as post-training assessments.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors
- The engagement with reputable vendors is a positive step. Ensure that there is a process for evaluating the performance of these vendors on a regular basis.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities
- The Gantt chart is a useful tool for tracking progress. Ensure that it is regularly updated and accessible to all stakeholders.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks
- The adoption of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework is commendable. Ensure that the framework is integrated into the bank's culture and not just seen as a compliance exercise.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections
- The cross-reference matrix is a good initiative. Ensure that it is kept up-to-date with any regulatory changes.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- The plan for iterative improvement is in line with agile principles. Ensure that the feedback loop includes not only the testing teams but also end-users and other stakeholders.
- The mid-point review session is a good practice. Consider scheduling these reviews more frequently, such as after each sprint, to allow for quicker adjustments.

## Additional Recommendations

- **Agile Alignment**: Ensure that the test plan is flexible enough to accommodate changes in scope or priorities without significant rework.
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Increase the frequency of stakeholder engagement to ensure continuous alignment with business objectives and user needs.
- **Tool Integration**: Consider how the various tools will integrate with each other to provide a seamless workflow and avoid data silos.
- **Training and Awareness**: Expand the training program to include all employees, not just those directly involved in the testing program, to foster a culture of security awareness.
- **Performance Metrics**: Develop more granular performance metrics for the testing program to measure efficiency, such as the average time to set up and execute a test.

By addressing these points, the test plan can be further refined to ensure that it not only meets the current requirements but is also positioned to adapt to future challenges.
