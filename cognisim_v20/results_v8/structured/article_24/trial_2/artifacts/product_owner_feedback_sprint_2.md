# Sprint 2 Test Plan Review Feedback

## General Feedback
The test plan for Sprint 2 is comprehensive and demonstrates a clear understanding of the importance of cybersecurity in the banking sector. The plan covers a range of critical areas, including the establishment of committees, dynamic testing strategies, resource allocation, and quality standards. The inclusion of KPIs, success criteria, and a focus on documentation and audit trails are commendable. However, there are areas where the plan could be improved to ensure better alignment with agile principles and to enhance the effectiveness of the testing strategy.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

#### Execution Procedures and Tools
- **Feedback:** The rationale for tool selection should not only be documented in meeting minutes but also in a formalized strategy document that is easily accessible and can be referenced by all team members.

#### Testing Frequencies and Schedules
- **Feedback:** The definition of "significant change" should be more than just documented; it should be operationalized with clear triggers for additional testing.

#### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions
- **Feedback:** The cross-training program is a great initiative. Ensure that the training matrix is updated in real-time and includes a succession plan for critical roles.

#### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria
- **Feedback:** Consider adding KPIs related to the effectiveness of the training programs and the overall security posture improvement over time.

#### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes
- **Feedback:** The plan should specify the frequency of access control audits for the document management system and include a process for regular review of the immutable log's security measures.

## Quality Standards

#### Immediately Actionable Guidance
- **Feedback:** Ensure that the training modules are updated regularly to reflect the latest threat landscape and testing methodologies.

#### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors
- **Feedback:** It's important to have a contingency plan in case a tool or vendor does not meet the expected performance standards.

#### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities
- **Feedback:** The Gantt chart should include milestones for the review and update of the test plan itself.

#### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks
- **Feedback:** The annual review of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework integration should result in actionable improvements, not just a check-box exercise.

#### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections
- **Feedback:** The cross-reference matrix should be easily understandable and actionable for individuals who are not compliance experts.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- **Feedback:** The feedback loop should be expanded to include lessons learned sessions that involve the entire team, not just end-users and stakeholders.

## Additional Recommendations

#### Agile Alignment
- **Feedback:** The adoption of agile methodologies should be reflected in the test plan with iterative testing cycles and feedback mechanisms.

#### Stakeholder Engagement
- **Feedback:** While increasing the frequency of stakeholder meetings is positive, ensure that these meetings have clear agendas and result in actionable outcomes.

#### Tool Integration
- **Feedback:** Integration plans should include a timeline and a clear set of criteria for successful integration.

#### Training and Awareness
- **Feedback:** The bank-wide training program should be tailored to different roles and departments, with metrics to measure the impact on security culture.

#### Performance Metrics
- **Feedback:** When developing performance metrics, consider including metrics that measure the impact of testing on the overall risk posture of the bank.

## Conclusion
Overall, the test plan is robust and demonstrates a strong commitment to cybersecurity. By incorporating the feedback provided, the plan can be further refined to ensure it is agile, actionable, and aligned with the bank's strategic objectives. Continuous improvement should be a key theme, with regular reviews and updates to the plan based on real-world testing outcomes and evolving threats.
