# Final Test Plan - Sprint 1

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Assessments and Tests:** Employ Nessus for vulnerability scanning, Metasploit for penetration testing, and IBM Resilient for incident response exercises.
- **Methodologies and Practices:** Follow NIST SP 800-53 for security controls and ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management.
- **Tools for Continuous Monitoring:** Utilize SIEM solutions like Splunk or IBM QRadar for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** Quarterly for all systems, with critical systems reviewed monthly.
- **Penetration Testing:** Annually, with critical systems tested bi-annually.
- **Scenario-Based Exercises:** Conduct bi-annual exercises, including one major annual drill involving all critical functions.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Dedicated Testing Team:** Includes security analysts, penetration testers, and incident responders.
- **External Auditors:** Engage third-party auditors for independent testing annually.
- **Role Definitions:** Clearly define roles within the testing team, including lead testers, analysts, and reporting officers.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **Vulnerability Management:** Track the number of vulnerabilities identified and remediated.
- **Incident Response:** Measure time to detect and respond to simulated incidents.
- **Testing Coverage:** Ensure testing spans across systems and business units.
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction:** Gauge satisfaction levels with the testing program.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Testing Reports:** Standardize documentation of all findings, recommendations, and remediation steps.
- **Audit Logs:** Maintain logs of all testing activities for auditor access.
- **Change Management Records:** Record any system changes resulting from testing.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- **Testing Program Charter:** Develop a charter outlining objectives, scope, roles, and responsibilities.
- **Testing Schedule:** Establish a detailed annual schedule with specific dates and teams involved.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- **Tools:** Nessus, Metasploit, IBM Resilient, Splunk, IBM QRadar.
- **Vendors:** Partner with Tenable, Rapid7, and IBM for tool support and updates.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- **Q2 2025:** Complete initial vulnerability assessments.
- **Q3 2025:** Execute the first scenario-based exercise.
- **Q4 2025:** Review and revise the testing program based on the year's findings.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- **Risk Assessment:** Prioritize testing based on the likelihood and impact of potential threats.
- **Critical Asset Identification:** Focus on systems and data critical to business operations.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- **Article 25 Compliance:** Align testing methodologies with ICT system resilience requirements.
- **Article 26 Compliance:** Ensure testing includes controls for managing ICT third-party risk.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- Establish a feedback loop within the DOR Testing Programme to integrate lessons learned into future testing cycles.
- Conduct a quarterly review of the DOR Testing Programme to evaluate its effectiveness and make necessary adjustments.
- Engage with regulatory bodies and industry peers to stay informed of best practices and emerging threats.
- Review the implementation plan with stakeholders to ensure alignment with business objectives and regulatory requirements.
- Actively seek stakeholder feedback throughout the implementation process to refine the program in subsequent iterations.
