# Final Cumulative Test Plan

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Assessments and Tests:** Utilize Nessus for vulnerability scanning, Metasploit for penetration testing, IBM Resilient for incident response exercises, IBM Security Rational Test Workbench and Micro Focus LoadRunner for performance testing, and OWASP ZAP for security testing.
- **Methodologies and Practices:** Follow NIST SP 800-53 for security controls, ISO/IEC 27001 for information security management, and adopt the FAIR methodology for risk assessment.
- **Tools for Continuous Monitoring:** Employ SIEM solutions like Splunk or IBM QRadar for real-time monitoring and anomaly detection.
- **Version Control System:** Implement Git and GitLab for version control to manage changes to documentation and tool configurations.
- **Issue Tracking and Remediation:** Use tools such as HP ALM for test management and JIRA for issue tracking.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Vulnerability Assessments:** Quarterly for all systems, with critical systems reviewed monthly.
- **Penetration Testing:** Annually, with critical systems tested bi-annually.
- **Scenario-Based Exercises:** Conduct bi-annual exercises, including one major annual drill involving all critical functions.
- **Regular Testing Schedule:** Conduct full-scale security audits bi-annually and comprehensive tests for all ICT systems annually during Q3 of the fiscal year.
- **Ad-Hoc Tests:** Initiate within 24 to 48 hours of threat identification or post-major system updates.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Dedicated Testing Team:** Comprise security analysts, penetration testers, auditors, test managers, analysts, and engineers with clearly defined roles and responsibilities.
- **Remediation Team:** Include developers, system administrators, network engineers, and a Compliance Officer to oversee the remediation process.
- **External Auditors:** Engage third-party auditors for independent testing annually.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **KPIs:** Track vulnerabilities identified and remediated, Mean Time to Remediate (MTTR), Test Coverage Ratio, Stakeholder Satisfaction Score, defect density, and recurrence of similar issues.
- **Success Criteria:** Timely remediation of vulnerabilities, no repeat findings in subsequent tests, and a reduction in the overall risk profile of the bank.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Testing Reports:** Standardize documentation of all findings, recommendations, and remediation steps.
- **Audit Logs:** Maintain logs of all testing activities for auditor access.
- **Change Management Records:** Record any system changes resulting from testing.
- **Automated Documentation:** Implement a SIEM system and an automated documentation system with bi-weekly manual review cycles.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- **Testing Program Charter:** Develop a charter outlining objectives, scope, roles, and responsibilities.
- **Testing Schedule:** Establish a detailed annual schedule with specific dates and teams involved.
- **Change Log:** Maintain a change log documenting updates to the testing charter, schedule, and environment.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- **Tools:** Nessus, Metasploit, IBM Resilient, Splunk, IBM QRadar, IBM Security Rational Test Workbench, Micro Focus LoadRunner, and OWASP ZAP.
- **Vendors:** Partner with Tenable, Rapid7, IBM, and other vendors for tool support and updates.
- **Maintenance:** Conduct monthly reviews for tool updates and bi-annual reviews to ensure tools remain industry-standard.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- **Milestones:** Break down the testing schedule into weekly milestones with specific deliverables, tracked using project management tools like JIRA or MS Project.
- **Deliverables:** Develop a detailed project timeline with milestones, intermediate steps, and dependencies.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- **Risk Assessment:** Prioritize testing based on the likelihood and impact of potential threats.
- **Critical Asset Identification:** Focus on systems and data critical to business operations.
- **Risk Matrix:** Regularly update the risk matrix to reflect the changing risk landscape.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- **Article Compliance:** Align testing methodologies with ICT system resilience requirements and third-party risk management.
- **Regulatory Updates:** Monitor changes and update the compliance matrix promptly.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- **Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback loop within the testing program to integrate lessons learned into future testing cycles.
- **Quarterly Reviews:** Evaluate the effectiveness of the testing program and make necessary adjustments.
- **Agile Alignment:** Ensure the testing plan remains flexible with a sprint-based approach, allowing for adjustments based on sprint retrospectives.
- **Stakeholder Engagement:** Schedule regular meetings with stakeholders to discuss testing progress and gather feedback.
- **Security Awareness:** Incorporate regular security awareness training for all staff, focusing on the latest ICT risks and best practices.
- **Tool Integration:** Leverage APIs to integrate testing tools, creating a unified dashboard for real-time monitoring and reporting.
- **Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:** Include regular testing of disaster recovery and business continuity plans.

By incorporating feedback from previous sprints and adhering to the outlined implementation requirements and quality standards, the bank will conduct a risk-based testing program that is effective, compliant, and adaptable to the evolving ICT risk landscape. The bank will ensure that its digital operational resilience testing program is robust, compliant, and continuously improving.
