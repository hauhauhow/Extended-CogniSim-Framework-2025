# Final Test Plan - Sprint 3

## IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Version Control System**: Implement Git and GitLab for version control to track and manage changes to both documentation and tool configurations, ensuring all changes are auditable.
- **Risk-Based Testing Procedure**: Adopt the FAIR (Factor Analysis of Information Risk) methodology for assessing and categorizing risks, integrating it with the testing procedures and documenting the process in the Risk Management Framework.
- **Tools for Issue Tracking and Remediation**: Utilize industry-standard tools such as HP ALM for test management, JIRA for issue tracking, and Nessus for vulnerability scanning.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Ad-Hoc Tests**: Establish a Threat Intelligence team responsible for monitoring emerging threats and communicating them to the testing team. Ad-hoc tests should be initiated within 24 to 48 hours of threat identification.
- **Regular Testing Schedule**: Conduct vulnerability assessments and penetration tests quarterly, full-scale security audits bi-annually, and comprehensive tests for all ICT systems annually during Q3 of the fiscal year.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Dedicated Testing Team**: Comprise a team of security analysts, penetration testers, auditors, test managers, analysts, and engineers. Ensure cross-training and define a protocol for scaling the team in response to increased demand.
- **Remediation Team**: Include developers, system administrators, network engineers, and a Compliance Officer to oversee the remediation process and ensure alignment with regulatory requirements.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **KPIs**: Track the number of vulnerabilities identified, time to remediate, recurrence of similar issues, test coverage, defect density, and mean time to remediation. If KPIs are not met, conduct a bi-monthly review and develop an action plan to address underlying issues.
- **Success Criteria**: Define success as the timely remediation of vulnerabilities, no repeat findings in subsequent tests, and a reduction in the overall risk profile of the bank.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Automated Documentation**: Implement a SIEM system and an automated documentation system with bi-weekly manual review cycles to verify accuracy and completeness. Use tools like Confluence for documentation management, with access control based on role definitions.
- **Review Process**: Establish a bi-weekly review of automated documentation by the Compliance Officer to verify accuracy and completeness.

## QUALITY STANDARDS

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- **Change Log**: Maintain a change log within the version control system and in Confluence, accessible to all stakeholders, documenting the rationale behind each change to the testing charter, schedule, and testing environment with timestamps and responsible parties.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- **Tool Suitability**: Evaluate tools against criteria such as effectiveness, ease of integration, and user feedback. Conduct tool reviews quarterly, trial new tools semi-annually, and document the review process and outcomes in the Tool Evaluation Report.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- **Deliverables**: Develop a detailed project timeline with milestones, intermediate steps, and dependencies using MS Project. Assign a Project Manager to monitor progress and address delays, establishing a protocol for delay reporting and mitigation.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- **Risk Matrix**: Regularly review and update the risk matrix monthly to reflect the changing risk landscape. Integrate the matrix into the decision-making process for prioritization and document it in the Testing Strategy Document.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- **Regulatory Updates**: Establish a Regulatory Affairs team responsible for monitoring changes and updating the compliance matrix within one month of any regulatory updates. Document the process in the Regulatory Monitoring Procedure.

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT

### Metrics for Reviews

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Include metrics such as the number of issues identified, remediated, and any outstanding issues. Develop a process for acting on these insights, such as adjusting policies or providing additional training, and document actions taken in the Testing Improvement Log.

### Agile Alignment

- **Retrospectives**: Conduct monthly retrospectives and include them in sprint retrospectives to discuss the effectiveness of testing tools and procedures. Use feedback to refine the test plan and ensure it remains flexible and relevant. Document outcomes and action items in the Sprint Retrospective Report.

### Stakeholder Engagement

- **Meeting Objectives**: Define clear objectives for stakeholder meetings, such as reviewing test findings, discussing remediation progress, and adjusting strategies based on feedback. Establish a feedback loop with documented outcomes influencing the testing program.

### Security Awareness

- **Training Effectiveness**: Measure the effectiveness of security awareness training through pre- and post-training assessments and monitoring the reduction in user-related incidents. Document the results and improvement actions in the Security Training Effectiveness Report.

### Tool Integration

- **Integration Plan**: Develop a clear plan for tool integration, including necessary technology investments and training programs to ensure seamless operation between systems. Review and update the plan annually.

### Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity

- **Testing and Documentation**: Conduct disaster recovery and business continuity tests bi-annually. Document results and address gaps within one month of testing in the Disaster Recovery Test Report.

### User Story: "Establish Procedures to Address Test Findings" Implementation Plan

- **Procedure Development**: Create a comprehensive policy document outlining the steps for prioritizing, classifying, and remediating issues based on the risk matrix and FAIR methodology.
- **Internal Validation Methodologies**: Implement a validation framework that includes peer reviews, automated testing tools, and manual checks to ensure all weaknesses, deficiencies, or gaps are fully addressed.
- **Remediation Tracking**: Use JIRA to track the progress of issue remediation and ensure that all actions are documented and validated.
- **Policy Review and Update**: Review and update the procedures and policies annually or upon significant changes in the risk environment or regulatory landscape.
- **Training and Awareness**: Provide regular training to all relevant staff on the new procedures and policies to ensure understanding and compliance.

By incorporating the feedback from the previous sprint, this implementation plan aims to provide a clear, efficient, and effective approach to addressing test findings and ensuring continuous improvement in the bank's risk management and compliance efforts.
