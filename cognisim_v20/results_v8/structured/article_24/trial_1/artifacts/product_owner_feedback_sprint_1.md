# Sprint 1 Test Plan Review Feedback

## General Feedback
The test plan for Sprint 1 is comprehensive and well-structured, covering a wide range of tools, methodologies, and practices to ensure the digital operational resilience of the bank. The plan is ambitious and sets clear expectations for the implementation of security measures and testing procedures. However, there are areas where further clarification or adjustments may be beneficial to ensure the successful execution of the plan.

## Specific Feedback

### Implementation Requirements

#### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools
- **Integration of Tools**: While the plan mentions the integration of SIEM solutions and GRC platforms, it would be beneficial to provide more details on how these integrations will be achieved and managed.
- **Tool Redundancy**: There is a potential overlap in the functionalities of the tools listed (e.g., IBM AppScan and Metasploit). Consider evaluating the need for each tool to optimize resource allocation and avoid redundancy.

#### Testing Frequencies and Schedules
- **Flexibility in Schedules**: The testing schedules are well-defined, but the plan should allow for flexibility to accommodate unforeseen events or critical issues that may require immediate attention outside of the predefined schedule.

#### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions
- **Role Clarity**: Ensure that the roles and responsibilities of the Testing Team and Digital Resilience Team are clearly differentiated to avoid confusion and overlap in duties.
- **Training Specificity**: Specify the types of training to be provided and the frequency to ensure that all team members are up-to-date with the latest cybersecurity practices.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria
- **KPI Realism**: The KPIs are ambitious, especially the 95% closure rate of identified vulnerabilities. It's important to ensure that these targets are realistic and achievable within the given timeframes.
- **Baseline Metrics**: Establish baseline metrics for each KPI to measure progress effectively.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes
- **Version Control**: Clarify the version control strategy for test reports to ensure that changes are tracked and managed properly.
- **Audit Trail Security**: Outline the security measures that will be in place to protect the integrity of audit trails.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance
- **Prioritization**: While immediate actions are outlined, prioritize these actions based on the current risk landscape and resource availability.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Consider the implications of vendor lock-in and explore the possibility of integrating open-source tools or alternative vendors to mitigate this risk.

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities
- **CISO Reporting**: Monthly progress reports are a good practice, but ensure that the reporting format is standardized and actionable.
- **Remediation Deadlines**: The 48-hour deadline for critical vulnerabilities is stringent. Ensure that the necessary resources and processes are in place to meet these deadlines.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks
- **Framework Alignment**: Verify that the FAIR model and other prioritization frameworks are aligned with the bank's existing risk management processes.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections
- **Regulatory Updates**: Establish a process for regularly updating the compliance matrix to reflect changes in regulatory requirements.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement
- **Feedback Loop**: Emphasize the importance of a feedback loop within the AARs to ensure that the lessons learned are effectively communicated and acted upon.
- **Pilot Test Scope**: Define the scope and objectives of the pilot test to ensure it provides meaningful insights.

## Conclusion
Overall, the test plan is robust and sets a strong foundation for the bank's digital operational resilience. However, by addressing the points mentioned above, we can enhance the clarity, effectiveness, and adaptability of the plan. It is crucial to maintain a balance between ambitious goals and realistic expectations to ensure the successful implementation and continuous improvement of the testing programme.
