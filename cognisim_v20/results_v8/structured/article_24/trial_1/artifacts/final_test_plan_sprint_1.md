# Final Test Plan - Sprint 1

## Implementation Requirements

### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools

- **Risk Assessment Tool**: Utilize RSA Archer or IBM OpenPages for identifying and evaluating ICT-related risks.
- **Testing Tools**: Implement HP LoadRunner for performance testing, Nessus for vulnerability scanning, IBM AppScan for security testing, and Metasploit for penetration testing.
- **Incident Management System**: Deploy ServiceNow or BMC Remedy for tracking and managing ICT-related incidents.
- **Methodologies and Practices**: Adopt the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and OWASP Top 10 for security assessments.
- **Tools Integration**: Ensure integration of SIEM solutions like Splunk and GRC platforms like RSA Archer.

### Testing Frequencies and Schedules

- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Monthly automated scans and bi-annual comprehensive scans.
- **Penetration Testing**: Annual testing by an external certified provider and semi-annual internal tests.
- **Business Continuity Testing**: Bi-annual BCP tests, including disaster recovery drills.
- **Tabletop Exercises**: Quarterly scenario-based assessments involving all relevant stakeholders.

### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions

- **Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**: Oversee the testing programme.
- **ICT Risk Manager**: Coordinate risk assessments and ensure integration with the bank's risk management framework.
- **Testing Team**: Comprised of internal auditors, security analysts, external consultants, cybersecurity experts, IT personnel, and compliance officers.
- **Digital Resilience Team**: Composed of cybersecurity experts, IT personnel, and compliance officers.
- **Training**: Provide regular training on the latest cybersecurity practices and regulatory requirements.

### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria

- **Incident Response Time**: Reduce average response time by 20% within the first year.
- **Remediation Closure Rate**: Achieve a 95% closure rate of identified vulnerabilities within agreed timeframes.
- **Test Coverage**: Ensure 100% coverage of critical systems and measure the time taken to remediate identified vulnerabilities.

### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes

- **Test Reports**: Document all test results in a centralized repository with version control.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain comprehensive logs of all ICT-related incidents and corrective actions.
- **Review Meetings**: Hold quarterly review meetings to assess the testing programme and update documentation.
- **Documentation**: Maintain records of all tests, findings, and remediation actions in a secure document management system.
- **Audit Trails**: Use automated logging tools to create immutable records of all system and user activities.

## Quality Standards

### Immediately Actionable Guidance

- **Risk Assessment**: Initiate a full ICT risk assessment using RSA Archer, with results expected within 60 days.
- **Tool Implementation**: Deploy Nessus within 30 days, with first scans scheduled within 45 days.
- **Testing Calendar**: Develop a detailed testing calendar with specific dates and responsible parties for each assessment and test.
- **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Create SOPs for each type of assessment and test.

### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors

- **ServiceNow**: Adopt for incident management, with full implementation and staff training completed within 90 days.
- **IBM AppScan**: Implement for security testing, with integration into the CI/CD pipeline within 60 days.
- **Established Tools**: Utilize tools with a proven track record, such as Tenable (Nessus), Rapid7 (Metasploit), Splunk, and RSA (Archer).

### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities

- **CISO**: Monthly progress reports to the executive committee.
- **ICT Risk Manager**: Deliver the initial risk assessment report by day 60 and manage ongoing risk monitoring.
- **Digital Resilience Coordinator**: Oversee the testing programme, ensuring adherence to the schedule and allocation of resources.
- **Vulnerability Remediation Deadlines**: Set based on severity, with critical vulnerabilities addressed within 48 hours.

### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks

- **Critical Asset Identification**: Use the FAIR model to prioritize testing based on asset criticality.
- **Threat Intelligence Integration**: Incorporate real-time threat intelligence feeds to adjust testing priorities dynamically.
- **Risk Assessment Matrix**: Prioritize vulnerabilities and incidents based on potential impact and likelihood.
- **Risk Appetite Alignment**: Align testing priorities with the bank's risk appetite and regulatory requirements.

### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections

- **Article 25 (Testing)**: Align the testing programme with the requirements, with a compliance matrix developed by the compliance team.
- **Articles 25 and 26**: Map each testing activity to the relevant sections, ensuring all legal requirements are met.

## Critical Instruction for Iterative Improvement

- **After-Action Reviews (AARs)**: Conduct AARs following each major test to identify lessons learned and integrate improvements.
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Solicit feedback from all stakeholders to refine the testing programme.
- **Benchmarking**: Regularly benchmark against industry peers and adjust practices accordingly.
- **Peer Review**: Conduct a peer review of the plan by cybersecurity and compliance experts.
- **Pilot Test**: Run a pilot test of the proposed testing programme to identify any potential issues or gaps.
- **Continuous Improvement Process**: Regularly review and update the testing programme based on evolving threats and regulatory changes.

By following this detailed implementation plan, the bank will establish a robust digital operational resilience testing programme that effectively manages and mitigates ICT risks.
