# Final Test Plan: Sprint 3

## Implementation Plan for User Story: US005 - Establish Procedures for Issue Management

### IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:

#### Specific Execution Procedures and Tools:
- **Issue Tracking System**: Implement JIRA or ServiceNow for issue management.
- **Classification Framework**: Develop a framework based on severity, impact, and urgency.
- **Remediation Workflow**: Establish a workflow with roles, timelines, and escalation procedures.
- **Validation Process**: Create a process involving re-testing and compliance team sign-off.
- **SIEM and GRC Platforms**: Utilize IBM QRadar for SIEM and RSA Archer for GRC, with contingency plans including Splunk and ServiceNow.
- **Tool Rationalization**: Document evaluation criteria and follow a phased approach for tool replacement.

#### Testing Frequencies and Schedules:
- **Regular Scans**: Conduct weekly vulnerability scans and compliance checks.
- **Penetration Testing**: Schedule annual third-party and bi-annual internal tests.
- **Ad-hoc Testing**: Perform ad-hoc testing for significant IT changes or threats.
- **Continuous Testing**: Use Selenium for automated testing and ELK Stack for data management.
- **Critical Event Response**: Test incident response bi-annually for significant threats or breaches.

#### Resource Allocation and Role Definitions:
- **Issue Management Team**: Allocate a dedicated team with compliance officers, IT security personnel, and business unit representatives.
- **Roles**: Define roles such as Issue Owner, Remediation Lead, and Compliance Validator.
- **Clear Role Delineation**: Communicate role changes through various internal channels.
- **Training Programs**: Evaluate training effectiveness with test scores and response times.

#### Measurable KPIs and Success Criteria:
- **Time to Remediate**: Track average remediation time.
- **Issue Backlog**: Monitor open issues against a threshold.
- **Re-occurrence Rate**: Measure the rate of issue re-occurrence.
- **KPI Adjustment**: Set and review KPIs like system uptime, incident response time, and customer impact.
- **Baseline Establishment**: Update baseline metrics quarterly against industry benchmarks.

#### Documentation and Audit Trail Processes:
- **Documentation Standard**: Adopt a standard for consistency and completeness.
- **Audit Trail**: Log actions in the issue tracking system for an audit trail.
- **Version Control Strategy**: Use Git with a clear policy for conflicts and rollbacks.
- **Audit Trail Protection**: Encrypt audit trails and perform bi-annual access reviews.

### QUALITY STANDARDS:

#### Immediately Actionable Guidance:
- **Issue Prioritization**: Use the classification framework for immediate prioritization.
- **Remediation Plans**: Document remediation plans with timelines and responsibilities.
- **Risk Assessment Matrix**: Update the matrix quarterly or after significant changes.

#### Industry-standard Tools and Vendors:
- **Tools**: Use JIRA, Tenable Nessus, IBM QRadar, and others as specified.
- **Vendors**: Engage with Crowdstrike, Deloitte, and other selected vendors.
- **Tool Evaluation Process**: Establish a semi-annual review process for tools and vendors.

#### Concrete Timelines and Responsibilities:
- **Timelines**: Set deadlines for issue management stages, like classification within 24 hours.
- **Responsibilities**: Assign and communicate issue management responsibilities.
- **Reporting Template Flexibility**: Review the CISO reporting template annually.

#### Risk-based Prioritization Frameworks:
- **FAIR Model**: Integrate the FAIR model to quantify risk and prioritize issues.
- **FAIR Model Integration**: Set a timeline for integrating the FAIR model and measure its effectiveness.

#### Compliance Mapping to Specific Article Sections:
- **Regulatory Alignment**: Map issue management to DORA and other regulations.
- **Regulatory Communication**: Establish a process for communicating regulatory changes.

### CRITICAL INSTRUCTION FOR ITERATIVE IMPROVEMENT:

#### Feedback Loop Enhancement:
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a formal feedback mechanism within the issue management process.
- **Feedback Action Plan**: Develop a plan for assessing and incorporating feedback.
- **Feedback Prioritization**: Define how feedback will be prioritized and actioned upon.

#### Pilot Test Definition:
- **Pilot Testing**: Conduct pilot tests with select users and systems.
- **Analysis and Adaptation**: Analyze pilot test results to refine the issue management process.
- **Pilot Test Analysis**: Detail how pilot test results will inform the broader issue management strategy.

#### Incorporating Previous Sprint's Feedback:
- Integration Management, Tool Optimization, Dynamic Scheduling, Critical Event Response, Clear Role Delineation, Training Programs, KPI Adjustment, Baseline Establishment, Version Control Strategy, Audit Trail Protection, and all other feedback points are addressed within the respective sections above.

#### Independent Testing:
- **Third-party Procurement**: Include a timeline for procuring third-party testing services and selection criteria.

### User Story: US006 - Conduct Annual Tests on ICT Systems:
- Develop an annual testing schedule for ICT systems, ensuring coverage of critical functions.
- Select third-party firms for independent testing based on expertise, performance, and cost.
- Start the procurement process three months before testing, with a one-month selection period followed by two months of preparation.

### Conclusion:

This final test plan synthesizes the feedback from the previous sprint, ensuring clarity, effectiveness, and continuous improvement. The plan is documented and communicated effectively, with regular reviews to adapt to the evolving risk landscape. It aligns with user story requirements and DORA regulations, maintaining operational resilience through annual testing of ICT systems.
