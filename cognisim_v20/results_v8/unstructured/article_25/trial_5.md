Creating a Data Subject Rights (DORA) compliance test plan for Article 25 for a large bank involves ensuring that the bank is in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements related to data protection by design and by default. Here is a high-level outline of a test plan for DORA compliance:

1. **Objective**: The objective of the test plan is to assess the bank's compliance with Article 25 of GDPR, focusing on data protection by design and by default principles.

2. **Scope**: The scope of the test plan includes all systems, processes, and procedures that involve the processing of personal data within the bank.

3. **Key Areas of Focus**:
   - Data Minimization: Evaluate whether the bank collects only the necessary personal data for the intended purpose.
   - Data Protection by Design: Assess if data protection measures are integrated into the development of systems and processes.
   - Data Protection by Default: Verify if the bank ensures that only necessary personal data is processed and that the highest level of data protection is applied by default.

4. **Test Approach**:
   - Review Documentation: Examine data protection policies, procedures, and documentation to ensure alignment with Article 25 requirements.
   - Data Mapping: Identify all personal data processed by the bank and assess if it complies with data minimization principles.
   - System Testing: Conduct testing of systems and applications to verify that data protection measures are implemented by design and by default.
   - Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA): Review DPIAs to ensure that risks to data subjects' rights and freedoms are adequately assessed and mitigated.
   - Training and Awareness: Evaluate the training provided to employees on data protection by design and by default principles.

5. **Testing Methodologies**:
   - Interviews: Conduct interviews with key stakeholders to understand their awareness of data protection requirements and their implementation.
   - Documentation Review: Analyze policies, procedures, and technical documentation to validate compliance with Article 25.
   - System Testing: Perform technical testing of systems to identify any gaps in data protection measures.

6. **Deliverables**:
   - Test Plan: Document outlining the approach, scope, and methodologies for the DORA compliance test.
   - Test Results Report: Report detailing the findings, recommendations, and remediation actions for any identified non-compliance issues.
   - Compliance Certificate: Certification of compliance with Article 25 requirements, if all areas are found to be in compliance.

7. **Timeline**: Define a timeline for the execution of the test plan activities, including testing, analysis, and reporting.

8. **Responsibilities**: Assign responsibilities to individuals or teams for the execution of the test plan activities, including testing, analysis, and reporting.

9. **Risk Assessment**: Identify and assess potential risks associated with non-compliance with Article 25 requirements and develop mitigation strategies.

10. **Review and Approval**: Ensure that the test plan is reviewed and approved by relevant stakeholders before implementation.

By following this test plan, the large bank can effectively assess its compliance with Article 25 of GDPR and ensure that data protection by design and by default principles are integrated into its operations.
