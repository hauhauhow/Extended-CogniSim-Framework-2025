### DORA Compliance Test Plan for Article 25 - Large Bank

#### Objective:
To ensure compliance with the Data-Oriented Risk Analysis (DORA) framework for Article 25 requirements for data protection in a large bank.

#### Scope:
The compliance test plan will cover the following key areas within the large bank's operations:
1. Data processing activities related to customer accounts and transactions.
2. Data storage and security measures.
3. Data transfer mechanisms within and outside the organization.
4. Data access controls and authorization processes.
5. Data retention and deletion policies.
6. Data breach response and notification procedures.

#### Test Plan Components:

1. **Data Mapping and Inventory:**
   - Review existing data inventory and mapping to identify personal data elements.
   - Verify that all personal data processing activities are documented and classified appropriately.

2. **Data Processing Assessment:**
   - Evaluate data processing activities to ensure they comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency.
   - Review data processing agreements with third parties to validate compliance with Article 25 requirements.

3. **Data Security Assessment:**
   - Conduct a security assessment to identify potential vulnerabilities in data storage and processing systems.
   - Review security measures in place to safeguard personal data against unauthorized access or disclosure.

4. **Data Transfer Mechanisms:**
   - Assess data transfer mechanisms to ensure compliance with data protection regulations.
   - Evaluate data transfer agreements with external parties to verify adequate safeguards for cross-border data transfers.

5. **Data Access Controls:**
   - Review access control policies and procedures to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to personal data.
   - Test access controls to validate the effectiveness of user authentication and authorization mechanisms.

6. **Data Retention and Deletion Policies:**
   - Evaluate data retention policies to ensure compliance with Article 25 requirements for limiting data storage.
   - Verify procedures for data deletion and disposal to prevent the retention of unnecessary personal data.

7. **Data Breach Response Testing:**
   - Conduct simulated data breach scenarios to test the bank's response and notification procedures.
   - Evaluate the effectiveness of incident response plans and communication strategies in the event of a data breach.

#### Testing Approach:
- Conduct a combination of document review, interviews with key stakeholders, and technical testing to validate compliance with Article 25 requirements.
- Perform on-site visits to observe data processing activities and security measures in practice.
- Engage internal and external auditors to provide independent assessments of DORA compliance.

#### Reporting and Follow-Up:
- Prepare a detailed test report outlining findings, recommendations, and remediation steps for any identified non-compliance issues.
- Work closely with the bank's data protection officer and compliance team to address and rectify any compliance gaps.
- Develop a follow-up plan to monitor ongoing compliance with the DORA framework and provide regular updates to senior management.

#### Compliance Testing Timeline:
- Initiate the compliance testing process within the next 30 days.
- Conduct testing activities over a period of 60-90 days, depending on the complexity of the bank's operations.
- Finalize the compliance test report and remediation plan within 15 days after completing all testing activities.

This DORA compliance test plan will help the large bank assess its adherence to Article 25 requirements and strengthen its data protection practices in line with regulatory guidelines.
