Sure, here is an example of a high-level DORA compliance test plan for Article 25 for a large bank:

1. Objective:
   - Ensure that the bank's data processing activities comply with the requirements of Article 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), also known as the Data Protection by Design and by Default principle.

2. Scope:
   - The test plan will cover all relevant data processing activities within the bank that involve personal data of EU residents.

3. Test Plan Components:
   a. Data Minimization:
      - Identify all data processing activities that involve personal data.
      - Evaluate whether the bank collects only the minimum amount of personal data necessary for each processing activity.
      - Review data retention policies to ensure that personal data is not retained longer than necessary.

   b. Data Protection Measures:
      - Assess the technical and organizational measures in place to protect personal data.
      - Verify that encryption, pseudonymization, and other security measures are implemented where necessary.
      - Review access controls and monitoring mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to personal data.

   c. Data Transfer Mechanisms:
      - Evaluate data transfer mechanisms to ensure that personal data is transferred securely within and outside the EU.
      - Confirm that appropriate safeguards are in place for international data transfers, such as Standard Contractual Clauses or Binding Corporate Rules.

   d. Data Processing Impact Assessments:
      - Review the bank's process for conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIAs) for high-risk processing activities.
      - Verify that DPIAs are carried out before implementing new data processing activities or making significant changes to existing ones.

   e. Accountability and Governance:
      - Assess the bank's accountability mechanisms, such as record-keeping and documentation of data processing activities.
      - Review the roles and responsibilities related to data protection and ensure clear accountability within the organization.

4. Test Methodology:
   - Conduct interviews with key stakeholders involved in data processing activities.
   - Review relevant policies, procedures, and documentation related to data protection.
   - Perform technical assessments of data security measures and controls.
   - Analyze data flows and identify potential risks to personal data.

5. Reporting:
   - Document test findings, including any non-compliance issues and recommendations for improvement.
   - Provide a summary report to management with an overview of the bank's compliance with Article 25 of GDPR.
   - Follow up on any remediation actions needed to address identified deficiencies.

6. Timeline:
   - The test plan should be executed within a specified time frame, considering the complexity and scale of the bank's data processing activities.

Please note that this is a high-level test plan and may need to be customized based on the specific data processing activities and risk profile of the bank. It is recommended to involve legal and compliance experts in the development and execution of the compliance test plan.
