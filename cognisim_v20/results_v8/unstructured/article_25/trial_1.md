To create a Data Ownership, Responsibility, and Accountability (DORA) compliance test plan for Article 25 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) for a large bank, you can follow these steps:

1. **Scope Definition:**
   - Define the scope of the test plan, including the systems, processes, and data flows within the bank that fall under the requirements of Article 25 of the GDPR.

2. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Identify and assess the risks associated with data ownership, responsibility, and accountability within the bank's operations.

3. **Compliance Requirements:**
   - Review Article 25 of the GDPR to understand the specific requirements related to data protection by design and by default.

4. **Test Objectives:**
   - Define the objectives of the compliance test plan, such as evaluating the bank's adherence to data protection principles, assessing the implementation of data protection measures, and ensuring accountability for data processing activities.

5. **Test Scenarios:**
   - Develop test scenarios that simulate real-world situations where data ownership, responsibility, and accountability are critical, such as data breaches, data access requests, data transfers, and data retention policies.

6. **Test Procedures:**
   - Outline the procedures for conducting the compliance tests, including data collection, analysis, and reporting mechanisms.

7. **Testing Tools:**
   - Identify and utilize appropriate testing tools and technologies to facilitate the compliance testing process, such as data monitoring tools, data encryption software, and data access logs.

8. **Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA):**
   - Conduct a DPIA to evaluate the potential risks to data subjects and the effectiveness of data protection measures implemented by the bank.

9. **Documentation and Reporting:**
   - Document the test results, including any non-compliance issues identified, and prepare a comprehensive report outlining the findings and recommendations for remediation.

10. **Review and Follow-Up:**
   - Review the test results with key stakeholders within the bank, address any identified issues, and establish a follow-up plan to ensure continuous compliance with Article 25 of the GDPR.

By following these steps and tailoring the test plan to the specific requirements and operations of the large bank, you can effectively assess compliance with data ownership, responsibility, and accountability obligations under Article 25 of the GDPR.
