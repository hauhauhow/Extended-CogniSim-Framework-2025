**Scope:**
The test plan will cover the following areas related to Article 24 compliance:
1. Identification and mapping of critical business functions and supporting operational processes.
2. Establishment of appropriate governance and oversight mechanisms for operational resilience.
3. Conducting regular risk assessments and scenario testing to evaluate the bank's resilience capabilities.
4. Implementing measures to ensure the security and integrity of critical information systems and data.
5. Developing and maintaining incident response and recovery plans to address disruptions.

**Test Plan:**

**1. Critical Business Functions Mapping**
- Review the bank's documentation to identify critical business functions and supporting operational processes.
- Verify that the bank has mapped dependencies between critical business functions and IT systems.

**2. Governance and Oversight**
- Evaluate the bank's governance structure to ensure clear accountability for operational resilience.
- Review policies, procedures, and controls related to operational resilience management.
- Check for regular reporting and oversight mechanisms in place.

**3. Risk Assessments and Scenario Testing**
- Assess the bank's risk assessment process for identifying and prioritizing operational risks.
- Evaluate the effectiveness of scenario testing in simulating potential disruptions and testing the bank's resilience.

- Test the bank's ability to recover critical systems and data in a timely manner.

**Reporting:**
After conducting the tests outlined in this plan, a detailed report will be prepared outlining the findings, recommendations, and any areas of non-compliance. The report will be shared with the bank's management for remediation and further action as needed.

**Conclusion:**
By following this test plan, the large bank can assess its compliance with Article 24 of DORA and strengthen its operational resilience capabilities to effectively manage and mitigate risks.
